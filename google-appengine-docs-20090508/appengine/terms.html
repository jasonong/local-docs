<p><b>Terms of Service</b> | <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Notice</a> | <a href="program_policies.html">Program Policies</a></p>

<h2><b>1. Your Agreement with 
Google</b></h2>
<p>1.1. Your use of the Google 
App Engine service (the &quot;Service&quot;) is governed by this agreement 
(the &quot;Terms&quot;). &quot;Google&quot; means Google Inc., located 
at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States, 
and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Service.</p>

<p>1.2. In order to use the Service, 
you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually 
using the Service. You understand and agree that Google will treat your 
use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>
<p>1.3. You may not use the Service 
if you are a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws 
of the United States or other countries including the country in which 
you are resident or from which you use the Service. You affirm that 
you are over the age of 13, as the Service is not intended for children 
under 13.</p>
<h2><b>2. Your Account and Use 
of the Service</b></h2>
<p>2.1. You must provide accurate 
and complete registration information any time you register to use the 
Service. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and 
for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized 
use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Google 
immediately.</p>
<p>2.2. Your use of the Service 
must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including 
any laws regarding the export of data or software. You agree not to 
use the Service in the design, development, production, or use of missiles 
or the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical 
or biological weapons.</p>
<p>2.3. You agree not to (a) access 
(or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Service by 
any means other than through the interface that is provided by Google 
in connection with the Service, unless you have been specifically allowed 
to do so in a separate agreement with Google, or (b) engage in any activity 
that interferes with or disrupts the Service (or the servers and networks 
which are connected to the Service).</p>
<h2><b>3. Service Policies and 
Privacy</b></h2>
<p>3.1. You agree to comply with 
the Google App Engine Program Policies included available at <a href="program_policies.html" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/appengine/program_policies.html</a> 

(or such URL as Google may provide) (the &quot;Program Policies&quot;) 
which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated 
from time to time.</p>
<p>3.2. The Service shall be subject 
to the privacy policy for the Service available at <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html</a> 
(or such URL as Google may provide), which references and incorporates 
Google&#39;s privacy policy available at <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/privacy.html</a>. 
You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Google&#39;s privacy 
policies.</p>
<p>3.3. You agree that you will 
protect the privacy and legal rights of the users of your application. 
You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for 
those users. To do so, at a minimum, you must incorporate the privacy 
terms available at <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html</a> into 
the privacy policy for your application. If the users provide you with 
user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, 
you must make the users aware that the information will be available 
to your application and to Google.</p>

<p>3.4. If the user provides you 
with Google Account information, you may only use that information to 
access the user&#39;s Google Account when, and for the limited purposes 
for which, the user has given you permission to do so.</p>
<h2><b>4. Fees for Use of the 
Service</b></h2>
<p>4.1. Subject to the Terms, 
the Service is provided to you without charge up to certain quotas. 
These quotas will be known as the &quot;Fee Threshold&quot; and can 
be found <a href="docs/quotas.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>4.2. A bill will be issued 
to your online account for all charges accrued in excess of the Fee 
Threshold.  For use of the Service in excess of any portion of the Fee 
Threshold, you shall be responsible for all charges up to the amount 
set in your online account, and shall pay all charges in U.S. Dollars 
or in such other currency as agreed to in writing by the parties.  Unless 
agreed to by the parties in writing, you shall pay all charges in accordance 
with the payment terms in the <a href="kb/index.html" target="_blank">Service 
FAQ</a>.  Late payments 
may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate 
permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are 
responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable 
expenses and attorneys fees Google incurs collecting late amounts. To 
the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to 
charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not 
affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on 
Google&#39;s measurements of your use of the Service, unless otherwise agreed 
to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) 
are at the discretion of Google and only in the form of credit for the 
Service. Nothing in these Terms obligates Google to extend credit to 
any party.  You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related 
billing and payment information that you provide to Google may be shared 
by Google with companies who work on Google&#39;s behalf, such as payment 
processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking 
credit, effecting payment to Google and servicing your account. Google 
may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such 
as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise 
its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Google shall not be 
liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. 
Google reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Service 
to you for any late payments.</p>

<p>4.3. Google may change its 
fees and payment policies for the Service with ninety (90) days prior 
notice. However, Google may change the Fee Threshold limits at its discretion. 
Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted in the Service 
FAQ or at <a href="terms.html" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/appengine/terms.html</a> (or such other 
URL Google may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes 
immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.</p>
<p>4.4. You may not develop multiple 
Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise 
access the Service in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.</p>
<h2><b>5. Content in the Service 
and Take Down Obligations</b></h2>
<p>5.1. You understand that all 
information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, 
audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) to 
which you may have access as part of, or through your use of, the Service 
are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. 
All such information is referred to below as the &quot;Content.&quot; 
The term Content shall specifically exclude the web application that 
you create using the Service and any source code written by you to be 
used with the Service (collectively, the &quot;Application&quot;).</p>

<p>5.2. Google reserves the right 
(but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, 
modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from the Service. You agree 
to immediately take down any Content that violates the Program Policies, 
including pursuant to a take down request from Google. In the event 
that you elect not to comply with a request from Google to take down 
certain Content, Google reserves the right to directly take down such 
Content or to disable the Application.</p>
<p>5.3. In the event that you 
become aware of any violation of the Program Policies by an end user 
of the Application, you shall immediately terminate such end user&#39;s 
account on your Application. Google reserves the right to terminate 
end user Google accounts or disable the Application in response to a 
violation or suspected violation of the Program Policies.</p>
<p>5.4. You agree that you are 
solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you 
or to any third party for) the Application or any Content that you create, 
transmit or display while using the Service and for the consequences 
of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) 
by doing so.</p>
<p>5.5. You agree that Google 
has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store 
any Content and other communications maintained or transmitted through 
use of the Service. You further acknowledge that you are solely responsible 
for securing and backing up your Application and any Content.</p>
<h2><b>6. Proprietary Rights</b></h2>
<p>6.1. You acknowledge and agree 
that Google (or Google&#39;s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest 
in and to the Service, including any intellectual property rights which 
subsist in the Service (whether those rights happen to be registered 
or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).</p>
<p>6.2. Unless you have agreed 
otherwise in writing with Google, nothing in the Terms gives you a right 
to use any of Google&#39;s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, 
domain names, and other distinctive brand features.</p>

<p>6.3. Except as provided in 
Section 8, Google acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, 
title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in 
or to any Content or the Application that you create, submit, post, 
transmit or display on, or through, the Service, including any intellectual 
property rights which subsist in that Content and the Application (whether 
those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world 
those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing 
with Google, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing 
those rights and that Google has no obligation to do so on your behalf.</p>
<h2><b>7. License from Google 
and Restrictions</b></h2>
<p>7.1. Google gives you a personal, 
worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to 
use the software provided to you by Google as part of the Service as 
provided to you by Google (referred to as the &quot;Google App Engine 
Software&quot; below). This license is for the sole purpose of enabling 
you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by Google, 
in the manner permitted by the Terms.</p>
<p>7.2. You may not (and you may 
not permit anyone else to): (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work 
of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the 
source code of the Google App Engine Software or any part thereof, unless 
this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been 
specifically told that you may do so by Google, in writing (e.g., through 
an open source software license); (b) attempt to disable or circumvent 
any security mechanisms used by the Service or any Application; (c) 
use the Service to create an Application that performs a malicious activity, 
including but not limited to spamming users, harvesting usernames and 
passwords, performing unauthorized scans of machines or ports or creating 
DoS attacks; or (d) upload or otherwise process any malicious content 
to or through the Service.</p>
<p>7.3. Unless Google has given 
you specific written permission to do so (e.g., through an open source 
software license), you may not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your 
rights to use the Google App Engine Software, grant a security interest 
in or over your rights to use the Google App Engine Software, or otherwise 
transfer any part of your rights to use the Software.</p>
<p>7.4. Open source software licenses 
for components of the Service released under an open source license 
constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the 
open source software licenses expressly supersede these Terms, the open 
source licenses govern your agreement with Google for the use of the 
components of the Service released under an open source license.</p>
<h2><b>8. License from You</b></h2>

<p>8.1. Google claims no ownership 
or control over any Content or Application. You retain copyright and 
any other rights you already hold in the Content and/or Application, 
and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate. 
By submitting, posting or displaying the Content on or through the Service 
you give Google a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license 
to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly 
display and distribute such Content for the sole purpose of enabling 
Google to provide you with the Service in accordance with its privacy 
policy. Furthermore, by creating an Application through use of the Service, 
you give Google a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license 
to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly 
display and distribute such Application for the sole purpose of enabling 
Google to provide you with the Service in accordance with its privacy 
policy.</p>
<p>8.2. You agree that Google, 
in its sole discretion, may use your trade names, trademarks, service 
marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features in presentations, 
marketing materials, customer lists, financial reports and Web site 
listings (including links to your website) for the purpose of advertising 
or publicizing your use of the Service.</p>
<h2><b>9. Software Updates</b></h2>
<p>9.1. The Software which you 
use may automatically download and install updates from time to time 
from Google. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further 
develop the Service and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, 
new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive 
such updates (and permit Google to deliver these to you) as part of 
your use of the Service.</p>
<h2><b>10. Modification and Termination 
of the Service</b></h2>
<p>10.1. Google is constantly 
innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its 
users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Service 
which Google provides may change from time to time without prior notice 
to you, subject to the terms in Sections 4.3 and 10.2.  Changes 
to the form and nature of the Service will be effective with respect 
to all versions of the Service (including the Deprecated Version of 
the Service); examples of changes to the form and nature of the Service 
include without limitation changes to fee and payment policies, security 
patches, added functionality, and other enhancements.</p>
<p>10.2. If Google in its discretion 
chooses to cease providing the current version of the Service whether 
through discontinuation of the Service or by upgrading the Service to 
a newer version, the current version of the Service will be deprecated 
and become the Deprecated Version of the Service.   Google will issue 
an announcement if the current version of the Service will be deprecated.   
For a period of 3 years after an announcement (the “Deprecation Period”), 
Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate 
the Deprecated Version of the Service and to respond to problems with 
the Deprecated Version of the Service deemed by Google in its discretion 
to be critical.   During the Deprecation Period, no new features will 
be added to the Deprecated Version of the Service.  <br>
</p>
<p>Google reserves the right in 
its discretion to cease providing all or any part of the Deprecated 
Version of the Service immediately without any notice if:  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>(A) you have breached any provision 
of the Terms (or have acted in manner that clearly shows that you do 
not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); 
or  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(B) Google is required to do 
so by law (for example, due to a change to the law governing the provision 
of the Deprecated Version of the Service); or  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(C) the Deprecated Version 
of the Service relies on data or services provided by a third party 
partner and the relationship with such partner (i) has expired or been 
terminated or (ii) requires Google to change the way Google provides 
the data or services through the Deprecated Version of the Service; 
or  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(D) providing the Deprecated 
Version of the Service could create a substantial economic burden as 
determined by Google in its reasonable good faith judgment; or  </p>
<p> </p>

<p>(E) providing the Deprecated 
Version of the Service could create a security risk or material technical 
burden as determined by Google in its reasonable good faith judgment. </p>
<p> <br>
At any time prior to discontinuing the current version of the Service 
or upgrading to a new version of the Service, Google may, in its discretion 
as part of its continuing innovation to provide the best possible experience 
for its users, label certain features or functionality of the Service 
as &quot;experimental.&quot;  This Section 10.2 of the Terms will not 
apply to any features or functionality labeled as &quot;experimental.&quot;</p>
<p>This Section 10.2 of the Terms 
also will not apply to the Google App Engine Software (as defined in 
Section 7.1).</p>
<p>10.3. You may discontinue your 
use of the Service at any time. Google may, at any time, terminate your 
use of the Service if (A) you have breached any provision of the Terms 
(or have acted in manner that clearly shows that you do not intend to, 
or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or (B) Google 
is required to do so by law (for example, due to a change to the law 
governing the provision of the Service); or (C) the Service relies on 
data or services provided by a third party partner and the relationship 
with such partner (i) has expired or been terminated or (ii) requires 
Google to change the way Google provides the data or services through 
the Service; or (D) providing the Service could create a substantial 
economic burden as determined by Google in its reasonable good faith 
judgment; or (E) providing the Service could create a security risk 
or material technical burden as determined by Google in its reasonable 
good faith judgment. </p>
<p>10.4. If Google suspends or 
terminates your use of the Service with cause (or you voluntarily discontinue 
your use of the Service), you will have access to, and the ability to 
export, your Content for a period of ninety (90) days following such 
suspension or termination. Fees will continue to be assessed for usage 
of the Service in excess of any portion of the Fee Threshold during 
the 90 day period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights set forth 
in this Section 10.4 are subject to your payment of any outstanding 
fees due upon and after termination for your use of the Service.</p>
<p>10.5. Upon any termination 
of the Service under Sections 4 or 10 , these Terms will also terminate, 
but Sections 6.1, 11, 12, 13, and 17 shall continue to be effective 
after these Terms are terminated.</p>

<h2><b>11. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES</b></h2>
<p>11.1. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS, 
INCLUDING SECTIONS 11 AND 12, SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT GOOGLE&#39;S WARRANTY 
OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED

<p>11.2. YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND 
AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT

<p>11.3. GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES 
AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIM 
ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICE INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES 
AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU 
THAT: (A) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (B) YOUR 
USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM 
ERROR, AND (C) USAGE DATA PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE.</p>
<h2><b>12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></h2>
<p>12.1. SUBJECT TO SECTION 11.1 
ABOVE, YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES 
AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY 
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES 
WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY. THIS SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, ANY LOSS OF PROFIT 
(WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), ANY LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS 
REPUTATION, ANY LOSS OF DATA SUFFERED, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE 
GOODS OR SERVICES, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS.</p>

<p>12.2. THE LIMITATIONS ON GOOGLE&#39;S 
LIABILITY TO YOU IN PARAGRAPH 12.1 ABOVE SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT 
GOOGLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.</p>
<h2><b>13. Indemnification</b></h2>
<p>13.1. You agree to hold harmless 
and indemnify Google, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, 
employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners, (collectively 
&quot;Google and Partners&quot;) from and against any third party claim 
arising from or in any way related to (a) your breach of the Terms, 
(b) your use of the Service, (c) your violation of applicable laws, 
rules or regulations in connection with the Service, or (d) your Content 
or your Application, including any liability or expense arising from 
all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, 
litigation costs and attorneys&#39; fees, of every kind and nature. In such 
a case, Google will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit 
or action.</p>
<h2><b>14. Policies Regarding 
Copyright and Trademarks</b></h2>
<p>14.1. You agree to set up a 
process to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with 
the United States&#39; Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA notices&quot;). 
It is Google&#39;s policy to respond to DMCA notices or other applicable 
copyright laws and to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers. We 
reserve the right to take down content in your Application or, if necessary, 
the Application itself upon receipt of a valid DMCA notice. For more

may be found at the following URL: <a href="http://www.google.com/permissions/guidelines.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/permissions/guidelines.html</a> 
(or such other URL Google may provide from time to time).</p>
<h2><b>15. Other Content</b></h2>
<p>15.1. The Services may include

Google may have no control over any web sites or resources which are

products or other materials on, or available from, such web sites or 
resources.</p>
<h2><b>16. Changes to the Terms</b></h2>
<p>16.1. Google may make changes

prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the Service.</p>
<p>17.2. There are no third party 
beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, 
and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture.</p>

<p>17.3. If Google provides you

English language version of these Terms will control if there is any 
conflict. </p>
<p>17.4. You agree that Google 
may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the 
Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Service.</p>
<p>17.5. You agree that if Google 
does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained 
in the Terms (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable 
law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google&#39;s rights 
and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.</p>
<p>17.6. Google shall not be liable 
for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from 
any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited
