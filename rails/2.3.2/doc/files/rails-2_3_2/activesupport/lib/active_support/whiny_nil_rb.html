    <pre># Extensions to +nil+ which allow for more helpful error messages for people who
# are new to Rails.
#
# Ruby raises NoMethodError if you invoke a method on an object that does not
# respond to it:
#
#   $ ruby -e nil.destroy
#   -e:1: undefined method `destroy' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
#
# With these extensions, if the method belongs to the public interface of the
# classes in NilClass::WHINERS the error message suggests which could be the
# actual intended class:
#
#   $ script/runner nil.destroy 
#   ...
#   You might have expected an instance of ActiveRecord::Base.
#   ...
#
# NilClass#id exists in Ruby 1.8 (though it is deprecated). Since +id+ is a fundamental
# method of Active Record models NilClass#id is redefined as well to raise a RuntimeError
# and warn the user. She probably wanted a model database identifier and the 4
# returned by the original method could result in obscure bugs.
#
# The flag &lt;tt&gt;config.whiny_nils&lt;/tt&gt; determines whether this feature is enabled.
# By default it is on in development and test modes, and it is off in production
# mode.
