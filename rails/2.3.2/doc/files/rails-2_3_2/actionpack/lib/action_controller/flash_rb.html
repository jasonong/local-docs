    <pre>module ActionController #:nodoc:
  # The flash provides a way to pass temporary objects between actions. Anything you place in the flash will be exposed
  # to the very next action and then cleared out. This is a great way of doing notices and alerts, such as a create
  # action that sets &lt;tt&gt;flash[:notice] = &quot;Successfully created&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; before redirecting to a display action that can
  # then expose the flash to its template. Actually, that exposure is automatically done. Example:
  #
  #   class PostsController &lt; ActionController::Base
  #     def create
  #       # save post
  #       flash[:notice] = &quot;Successfully created post&quot;
  #       redirect_to posts_path(@post)
  #     end
  #
  #     def show
  #       # doesn't need to assign the flash notice to the template, that's done automatically
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   show.html.erb
  #     &lt;% if flash[:notice] %&gt;
  #       &lt;div class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt;&lt;%= flash[:notice] %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  #     &lt;% end %&gt;
  #
  # This example just places a string in the flash, but you can put any object in there. And of course, you can put as
  # many as you like at a time too. Just remember: They'll be gone by the time the next action has been performed.
  #
  # See docs on the FlashHash class for more details about the flash.
