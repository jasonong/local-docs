module ActionController
  # == Routing
  #
  # The routing module provides URL rewriting in native Ruby. It's a way to
  # redirect incoming requests to controllers and actions. This replaces
  # mod_rewrite rules. Best of all, Rails' Routing works with any web server.
  # Routes are defined in &lt;tt&gt;config/routes.rb&lt;/tt&gt;.
  #
  # Consider the following route, installed by Rails when you generate your
  # application:
  #
  #   map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'
  #
  # This route states that it expects requests to consist of a
  # &lt;tt&gt;:controller&lt;/tt&gt; followed by an &lt;tt&gt;:action&lt;/tt&gt; that in turn is fed
  # some &lt;tt&gt;:id&lt;/tt&gt;.
  #
  # Suppose you get an incoming request for &lt;tt&gt;/blog/edit/22&lt;/tt&gt;, you'll end up
  # with:
  #
  #   params = { :controller =&gt; 'blog',
  #              :action     =&gt; 'edit',
  #              :id         =&gt; '22'
  #           }
  #
  # Think of creating routes as drawing a map for your requests. The map tells
  # them where to go based on some predefined pattern:
  #
  #   ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  #     Pattern 1 tells some request to go to one place
  #     Pattern 2 tell them to go to another
  #     ...
  #   end
  #
  # The following symbols are special:
  #
  #   :controller maps to your controller name
  #   :action     maps to an action with your controllers
  #
  # Other names simply map to a parameter as in the case of &lt;tt&gt;:id&lt;/tt&gt;.
  #
  # == Route priority
  #
  # Not all routes are created equally. Routes have priority defined by the
  # order of appearance of the routes in the &lt;tt&gt;config/routes.rb&lt;/tt&gt; file. The priority goes
  # from top to bottom. The last route in that file is at the lowest priority
  # and will be applied last. If no route matches, 404 is returned.
  #
  # Within blocks, the empty pattern is at the highest priority.
  # In practice this works out nicely:
  #
  #   ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  #     map.with_options :controller =&gt; 'blog' do |blog|
  #       blog.show '',  :action =&gt; 'list'
  #     end
  #     map.connect ':controller/:action/:view'
  #   end
  #
  # In this case, invoking blog controller (with an URL like '/blog/')
  # without parameters will activate the 'list' action by default.
  #
  # == Defaults routes and default parameters
  #
  # Setting a default route is straightforward in Rails - you simply append a
  # Hash at the end of your mapping to set any default parameters.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   ActionController::Routing:Routes.draw do |map|
  #     map.connect ':controller/:action/:id', :controller =&gt; 'blog'
  #   end
  #
  # This sets up +blog+ as the default controller if no other is specified.
  # This means visiting '/' would invoke the blog controller.
  #
  # More formally, you can include arbitrary parameters in the route, thus:
  #
  #   map.connect ':controller/:action/:id', :action =&gt; 'show', :page =&gt; 'Dashboard'
  #
  # This will pass the :page parameter to all incoming requests that match this route.
  #
  # Note: The default routes, as provided by the Rails generator, make all actions in every
  # controller accessible via GET requests. You should consider removing them or commenting
  # them out if you're using named routes and resources.
  #
  # == Named routes
  #
  # Routes can be named with the syntax &lt;tt&gt;map.name_of_route options&lt;/tt&gt;,
  # allowing for easy reference within your source as +name_of_route_url+
  # for the full URL and +name_of_route_path+ for the URI path.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   # In routes.rb
  #   map.login 'login', :controller =&gt; 'accounts', :action =&gt; 'login'
  #
  #   # With render, redirect_to, tests, etc.
  #   redirect_to login_url
  #
  # Arguments can be passed as well.
  #
  #   redirect_to show_item_path(:id =&gt; 25)
  #
  # Use &lt;tt&gt;map.root&lt;/tt&gt; as a shorthand to name a route for the root path &quot;&quot;.
  #
  #   # In routes.rb
  #   map.root :controller =&gt; 'blogs'
  #
  #   # would recognize http://www.example.com/ as
  #   params = { :controller =&gt; 'blogs', :action =&gt; 'index' }
  #
  #   # and provide these named routes
  #   root_url   # =&gt; 'http://www.example.com/'
  #   root_path  # =&gt; ''
  #
  # You can also specify an already-defined named route in your &lt;tt&gt;map.root&lt;/tt&gt; call:
  #
  #   # In routes.rb
  #   map.new_session :controller =&gt; 'sessions', :action =&gt; 'new'
  #   map.root :new_session
  #
  # Note: when using +with_options+, the route is simply named after the
  # method you call on the block parameter rather than map.
  #
  #   # In routes.rb
  #   map.with_options :controller =&gt; 'blog' do |blog|
  #     blog.show    '',            :action  =&gt; 'list'
  #     blog.delete  'delete/:id',  :action  =&gt; 'delete',
  #     blog.edit    'edit/:id',    :action  =&gt; 'edit'
  #   end
  #
  #   # provides named routes for show, delete, and edit
  #   link_to @article.title, show_path(:id =&gt; @article.id)
  #
  # == Pretty URLs
  #
  # Routes can generate pretty URLs. For example:
  #
  #   map.connect 'articles/:year/:month/:day',
  #               :controller =&gt; 'articles',
  #               :action     =&gt; 'find_by_date',
  #               :year       =&gt; /\d{4}/,
  #               :month      =&gt; /\d{1,2}/,
  #               :day        =&gt; /\d{1,2}/
  #
  # Using the route above, the URL &quot;http://localhost:3000/articles/2005/11/06&quot;
  # maps to
  #
  #   params = {:year =&gt; '2005', :month =&gt; '11', :day =&gt; '06'}
  #
  # == Regular Expressions and parameters
  # You can specify a regular expression to define a format for a parameter.
  #
  #   map.geocode 'geocode/:postalcode', :controller =&gt; 'geocode',
  #               :action =&gt; 'show', :postalcode =&gt; /\d{5}(-\d{4})?/
  #
  # or, more formally:
  #
  #   map.geocode 'geocode/:postalcode', :controller =&gt; 'geocode',
  #               :action =&gt; 'show', :requirements =&gt; { :postalcode =&gt; /\d{5}(-\d{4})?/ }
  #
  # Formats can include the 'ignorecase' and 'extended syntax' regular
  # expression modifiers:
  #
  #   map.geocode 'geocode/:postalcode', :controller =&gt; 'geocode',
  #               :action =&gt; 'show', :postalcode =&gt; /hx\d\d\s\d[a-z]{2}/i
  #
  #   map.geocode 'geocode/:postalcode', :controller =&gt; 'geocode',
  #               :action =&gt; 'show',:requirements =&gt; {
  #                 :postalcode =&gt; /# Postcode format
  #                                 \d{5} #Prefix
  #                                 (-\d{4})? #Suffix
  #                                 /x
  #               }
  #
  # Using the multiline match modifier will raise an ArgumentError.
  # Encoding regular expression modifiers are silently ignored. The
  # match will always use the default encoding or ASCII.
  #
  # == Route globbing
  #
  # Specifying &lt;tt&gt;*[string]&lt;/tt&gt; as part of a rule like:
  #
  #   map.connect '*path' , :controller =&gt; 'blog' , :action =&gt; 'unrecognized?'
  #
  # will glob all remaining parts of the route that were not recognized earlier. 
  # The globbed values are in &lt;tt&gt;params[:path]&lt;/tt&gt; as an array of path segments.
  #
  # == Route conditions
  #
  # With conditions you can define restrictions on routes. Currently the only valid condition is &lt;tt&gt;:method&lt;/tt&gt;.
  #
  # * &lt;tt&gt;:method&lt;/tt&gt; - Allows you to specify which method can access the route. Possible values are &lt;tt&gt;:post&lt;/tt&gt;,
  #   &lt;tt&gt;:get&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;:put&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;:delete&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;:any&lt;/tt&gt;. The default value is &lt;tt&gt;:any&lt;/tt&gt;,
  #   &lt;tt&gt;:any&lt;/tt&gt; means that any method can access the route.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   map.connect 'post/:id', :controller =&gt; 'posts', :action =&gt; 'show',
  #               :conditions =&gt; { :method =&gt; :get }
  #   map.connect 'post/:id', :controller =&gt; 'posts', :action =&gt; 'create_comment',
  #               :conditions =&gt; { :method =&gt; :post }
  #
  # Now, if you POST to &lt;tt&gt;/posts/:id&lt;/tt&gt;, it will route to the &lt;tt&gt;create_comment&lt;/tt&gt; action. A GET on the same
  # URL will route to the &lt;tt&gt;show&lt;/tt&gt; action.
  #
  # == Reloading routes
  #
  # You can reload routes if you feel you must:
  #
  #   ActionController::Routing::Routes.reload
  #
  # This will clear all named routes and reload routes.rb if the file has been modified from
  # last load. To absolutely force reloading, use &lt;tt&gt;reload!&lt;/tt&gt;.
  #
  # == Testing Routes
  #
  # The two main methods for testing your routes:
  #
  # === +assert_routing+
  #
  #   def test_movie_route_properly_splits
  #    opts = {:controller =&gt; &quot;plugin&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;checkout&quot;, :id =&gt; &quot;2&quot;}
  #    assert_routing &quot;plugin/checkout/2&quot;, opts
  #   end
  #
  # +assert_routing+ lets you test whether or not the route properly resolves into options.
  #
  # === +assert_recognizes+
  #
  #   def test_route_has_options
  #    opts = {:controller =&gt; &quot;plugin&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;, :id =&gt; &quot;12&quot;}
  #    assert_recognizes opts, &quot;/plugins/show/12&quot;
  #   end
  #
  # Note the subtle difference between the two: +assert_routing+ tests that
  # a URL fits options while +assert_recognizes+ tests that a URL
  # breaks into parameters properly.
  #
  # In tests you can simply pass the URL or named route to +get+ or +post+.
  #
  #   def send_to_jail
  #     get '/jail'
  #     assert_response :success
  #     assert_template &quot;jail/front&quot;
  #   end
  #
  #   def goes_to_login
  #     get login_url
  #     #...
  #   end
  #
