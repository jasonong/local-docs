  module Assertions
    # Pair of assertions to testing elements in the HTML output of the response.
    module TagAssertions
      # Asserts that there is a tag/node/element in the body of the response
      # that meets all of the given conditions. The +conditions+ parameter must
      # be a hash of any of the following keys (all are optional):
      #
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:tag&lt;/tt&gt;: the node type must match the corresponding value
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:attributes&lt;/tt&gt;: a hash. The node's attributes must match the
      #   corresponding values in the hash.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:parent&lt;/tt&gt;: a hash. The node's parent must match the
      #   corresponding hash.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:child&lt;/tt&gt;: a hash. At least one of the node's immediate children
      #   must meet the criteria described by the hash.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:ancestor&lt;/tt&gt;: a hash. At least one of the node's ancestors must
      #   meet the criteria described by the hash.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:descendant&lt;/tt&gt;: a hash. At least one of the node's descendants
      #   must meet the criteria described by the hash.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:sibling&lt;/tt&gt;: a hash. At least one of the node's siblings must
      #   meet the criteria described by the hash.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:after&lt;/tt&gt;: a hash. The node must be after any sibling meeting
      #   the criteria described by the hash, and at least one sibling must match.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:before&lt;/tt&gt;: a hash. The node must be before any sibling meeting
      #   the criteria described by the hash, and at least one sibling must match.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:children&lt;/tt&gt;: a hash, for counting children of a node. Accepts
      #   the keys:
      #   * &lt;tt&gt;:count&lt;/tt&gt;: either a number or a range which must equal (or
      #     include) the number of children that match.
      #   * &lt;tt&gt;:less_than&lt;/tt&gt;: the number of matching children must be less
      #     than this number.
      #   * &lt;tt&gt;:greater_than&lt;/tt&gt;: the number of matching children must be
      #     greater than this number.
      #   * &lt;tt&gt;:only&lt;/tt&gt;: another hash consisting of the keys to use
      #     to match on the children, and only matching children will be
      #     counted.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:content&lt;/tt&gt;: the textual content of the node must match the
      #   given value. This will not match HTML tags in the body of a
      #   tag--only text.
      #
      # Conditions are matched using the following algorithm:
      #
      # * if the condition is a string, it must be a substring of the value.
      # * if the condition is a regexp, it must match the value.
      # * if the condition is a number, the value must match number.to_s.
      # * if the condition is +true+, the value must not be +nil+.
      # * if the condition is +false+ or +nil+, the value must be +nil+.

      #   assert_tag :span
      #
      #   # Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; tag with id=&quot;x&quot; using the short-hand
      #   assert_tag :span, :attributes =&gt; { :id =&gt; &quot;x&quot; }
      #
      #   # Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; inside of a &quot;div&quot;

      #
      #   # Assert that there is a &quot;span&quot; containing a (possibly nested)
      #   # &quot;strong&quot; tag.

      #   # and an &quot;li&quot; parent (with &quot;class&quot; = &quot;enum&quot;), and containing a

      # &lt;b&gt;Please note&lt;/b&gt;: +assert_tag+ and +assert_no_tag+ only work
      # with well-formed XHTML. They recognize a few tags as implicitly self-closing
      # (like br and hr and such) but will not work correctly with tags
      # that allow optional closing tags (p, li, td). &lt;em&gt;You must explicitly
