  # One thing that has always been a pain with remote web services is testing.  The HttpMock
  # class makes it easy to test your Active Resource models by creating a set of mock responses to specific
  # requests.
  #
  # To test your Active Resource model, you simply call the ActiveResource::HttpMock.respond_to
  # method with an attached block.  The block declares a set of URIs with expected input, and the output
  # each request should return.  The passed in block has any number of entries in the following generalized
  # format:
  #
  #   mock.http_method(path, request_headers = {}, body = nil, status = 200, response_headers = {})
  #
  # * &lt;tt&gt;http_method&lt;/tt&gt; - The HTTP method to listen for.  This can be +get+, +post+, +put+, +delete+ or
  #   +head+.
  # * &lt;tt&gt;path&lt;/tt&gt; - A string, starting with a &quot;/&quot;, defining the URI that is expected to be
  #   called.
  # * &lt;tt&gt;request_headers&lt;/tt&gt; - Headers that are expected along with the request.  This argument uses a
  #   hash format, such as &lt;tt&gt;{ &quot;Content-Type&quot; =&gt; &quot;application/xml&quot; }&lt;/tt&gt;.  This mock will only trigger
  #   if your tests sends a request with identical headers.
  # * &lt;tt&gt;body&lt;/tt&gt; - The data to be returned.  This should be a string of Active Resource parseable content,
  #   such as XML.
  # * &lt;tt&gt;status&lt;/tt&gt; - The HTTP response code, as an integer, to return with the response.
  # * &lt;tt&gt;response_headers&lt;/tt&gt; - Headers to be returned with the response.  Uses the same hash format as
  #   &lt;tt&gt;request_headers&lt;/tt&gt; listed above.
  #
  # In order for a mock to deliver its content, the incoming request must match by the &lt;tt&gt;http_method&lt;/tt&gt;,
  # +path+ and &lt;tt&gt;request_headers&lt;/tt&gt;.  If no match is found an InvalidRequestError exception
  # will be raised letting you know you need to create a new mock for that request.
  #
  # ==== Example
  #   def setup
  #     @matz  = { :id =&gt; 1, :name =&gt; &quot;Matz&quot; }.to_xml(:root =&gt; &quot;person&quot;)
  #     ActiveResource::HttpMock.respond_to do |mock|
  #       mock.post   &quot;/people.xml&quot;,   {}, @matz, 201, &quot;Location&quot; =&gt; &quot;/people/1.xml&quot;
  #       mock.get    &quot;/people/1.xml&quot;, {}, @matz
  #       mock.put    &quot;/people/1.xml&quot;, {}, nil, 204
  #       mock.delete &quot;/people/1.xml&quot;, {}, nil, 200
  #     end
  #   end

  #   def test_get_matz
  #     person = Person.find(1)
  #     assert_equal &quot;Matz&quot;, person.name
