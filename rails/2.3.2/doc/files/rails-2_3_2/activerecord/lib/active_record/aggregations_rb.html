    # Active Record implements aggregation through a macro-like class method called +composed_of+ for representing attributes
    # as value objects. It expresses relationships like &quot;Account [is] composed of Money [among other things]&quot; or &quot;Person [is]
    # composed of [an] address&quot;. Each call to the macro adds a description of how the value objects are created from the
    # attributes of the entity object (when the entity is initialized either as a new object or from finding an existing object)
    # and how it can be turned back into attributes (when the entity is saved to the database). Example:
    #
    #   class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     composed_of :balance, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Money&quot;, :mapping =&gt; %w(balance amount)
    #     composed_of :address, :mapping =&gt; [ %w(address_street street), %w(address_city city) ]
    #   end
    #
    # The customer class now has the following methods to manipulate the value objects:
    # * &lt;tt&gt;Customer#balance, Customer#balance=(money)&lt;/tt&gt;
    # * &lt;tt&gt;Customer#address, Customer#address=(address)&lt;/tt&gt;
    #
    # These methods will operate with value objects like the ones described below:
    #
    #  class Money
    #    include Comparable
    #    attr_reader :amount, :currency
    #    EXCHANGE_RATES = { &quot;USD_TO_DKK&quot; =&gt; 6 }
    #
    #    def initialize(amount, currency = &quot;USD&quot;)
    #      @amount, @currency = amount, currency
    #    end
    #
    #    def exchange_to(other_currency)
    #      exchanged_amount = (amount * EXCHANGE_RATES[&quot;#{currency}_TO_#{other_currency}&quot;]).floor
    #      Money.new(exchanged_amount, other_currency)
    #    end
    #
    #    def ==(other_money)
    #      amount == other_money.amount &amp;&amp; currency == other_money.currency
    #    end
    #
    #    def &lt;=&gt;(other_money)
    #      if currency == other_money.currency
    #        amount &lt;=&gt; amount
    #      else
    #        amount &lt;=&gt; other_money.exchange_to(currency).amount
    #      end
    #    end
    #  end
    #
    #  class Address
    #    attr_reader :street, :city
    #    def initialize(street, city)
    #      @street, @city = street, city
    #    end
    #
    #    def close_to?(other_address)
    #      city == other_address.city
    #    end
    #
    #    def ==(other_address)
    #      city == other_address.city &amp;&amp; street == other_address.street
    #    end
    #  end
    #
    # Now it's possible to access attributes from the database through the value objects instead. If you choose to name the
    # composition the same as the attribute's name, it will be the only way to access that attribute. That's the case with our
    # +balance+ attribute. You interact with the value objects just like you would any other attribute, though:
    #
    #   customer.balance = Money.new(20)     # sets the Money value object and the attribute
    #   customer.balance                     # =&gt; Money value object
    #   customer.balance.exchange_to(&quot;DKK&quot;)  # =&gt; Money.new(120, &quot;DKK&quot;)
    #   customer.balance &gt; Money.new(10)     # =&gt; true
    #   customer.balance == Money.new(20)    # =&gt; true
    #   customer.balance &lt; Money.new(5)      # =&gt; false
    #
    # Value objects can also be composed of multiple attributes, such as the case of Address. The order of the mappings will
    # determine the order of the parameters. Example:
    #
    #   customer.address_street = &quot;Hyancintvej&quot;
    #   customer.address_city   = &quot;Copenhagen&quot;
    #   customer.address        # =&gt; Address.new(&quot;Hyancintvej&quot;, &quot;Copenhagen&quot;)
    #   customer.address = Address.new(&quot;May Street&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;)
    #   customer.address_street # =&gt; &quot;May Street&quot;
    #   customer.address_city   # =&gt; &quot;Chicago&quot;
    #
    # == Writing value objects
    #
    # Value objects are immutable and interchangeable objects that represent a given value, such as a Money object representing
    # $5. Two Money objects both representing $5 should be equal (through methods such as &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; from Comparable if ranking
    # makes sense). This is unlike entity objects where equality is determined by identity. An entity class such as Customer can
    # easily have two different objects that both have an address on Hyancintvej. Entity identity is determined by object or
    # relational unique identifiers (such as primary keys). Normal ActiveRecord::Base classes are entity objects.
    #
    # It's also important to treat the value objects as immutable. Don't allow the Money object to have its amount changed after
    # creation. Create a new Money object with the new value instead. This is exemplified by the Money#exchange_to method that
    # returns a new value object instead of changing its own values. Active Record won't persist value objects that have been
    # changed through means other than the writer method.
    #
    # The immutable requirement is enforced by Active Record by freezing any object assigned as a value object. Attempting to
    # change it afterwards will result in a ActiveSupport::FrozenObjectError.
    #
    # Read more about value objects on http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ValueObject and on the dangers of not keeping value objects
    # immutable on http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ValueObjectsShouldBeImmutable
    #
    # == Custom constructors and converters
    #
    # By default value objects are initialized by calling the &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; constructor of the value class passing each of the
    # mapped attributes, in the order specified by the &lt;tt&gt;:mapping&lt;/tt&gt; option, as arguments. If the value class doesn't support
    # this convention then +composed_of+ allows a custom constructor to be specified.
    #
    # When a new value is assigned to the value object the default assumption is that the new value is an instance of the value
    # class. Specifying a custom converter allows the new value to be automatically converted to an instance of value class if
    # necessary.
    #
    # For example, the NetworkResource model has +network_address+ and +cidr_range+ attributes that should be aggregated using the
    # NetAddr::CIDR value class (http://netaddr.rubyforge.org). The constructor for the value class is called +create+ and it
    # expects a CIDR address string as a parameter. New values can be assigned to the value object using either another
    # NetAddr::CIDR object, a string or an array. The &lt;tt&gt;:constructor&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;:converter&lt;/tt&gt; options can be used to
    # meet these requirements:
    #
    #   class NetworkResource &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     composed_of :cidr,
    #                 :class_name =&gt; 'NetAddr::CIDR',
    #                 :mapping =&gt; [ %w(network_address network), %w(cidr_range bits) ],
    #                 :allow_nil =&gt; true,
    #                 :constructor =&gt; Proc.new { |network_address, cidr_range| NetAddr::CIDR.create(&quot;#{network_address}/#{cidr_range}&quot;) },
    #                 :converter =&gt; Proc.new { |value| NetAddr::CIDR.create(value.is_a?(Array) ? value.join('/') : value) }
    #   end
    #
    #   # This calls the :constructor
    #   network_resource = NetworkResource.new(:network_address =&gt; '192.168.0.1', :cidr_range =&gt; 24)
    #
    #   # These assignments will both use the :converter
    #   network_resource.cidr = [ '192.168.2.1', 8 ]
    #   network_resource.cidr = '192.168.0.1/24'
    #
    #   # This assignment won't use the :converter as the value is already an instance of the value class
    #   network_resource.cidr = NetAddr::CIDR.create('192.168.2.1/8')
    #
    #   # Saving and then reloading will use the :constructor on reload
    #   network_resource.save
    #   network_resource.reload
    #
    # == Finding records by a value object
    #
    # Once a +composed_of+ relationship is specified for a model, records can be loaded from the database by specifying an instance
    # of the value object in the conditions hash. The following example finds all customers with +balance_amount+ equal to 20 and
    # +balance_currency+ equal to &quot;USD&quot;:
    #
    #   Customer.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; {:balance =&gt; Money.new(20, &quot;USD&quot;)})
    #
    module ClassMethods
      # Adds reader and writer methods for manipulating a value object:
      # &lt;tt&gt;composed_of :address&lt;/tt&gt; adds &lt;tt&gt;address&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;address=(new_address)&lt;/tt&gt; methods.
      #
      # Options are:
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:class_name&lt;/tt&gt; - Specifies the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred
      #   from the part id. So &lt;tt&gt;composed_of :address&lt;/tt&gt; will by default be linked to the Address class, but
      #   if the real class name is CompanyAddress, you'll have to specify it with this option.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:mapping&lt;/tt&gt; - Specifies the mapping of entity attributes to attributes of the value object. Each mapping
      #   is represented as an array where the first item is the name of the entity attribute and the second item is the
      #   name the attribute in the value object. The order in which mappings are defined determine the order in which
      #   attributes are sent to the value class constructor.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:allow_nil&lt;/tt&gt; - Specifies that the value object will not be instantiated when all mapped
      #   attributes are +nil+.  Setting the value object to +nil+ has the effect of writing +nil+ to all mapped attributes.
      #   This defaults to +false+.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:constructor&lt;/tt&gt; - A symbol specifying the name of the constructor method or a Proc that is called to
      #   initialize the value object. The constructor is passed all of the mapped attributes, in the order that they
      #   are defined in the &lt;tt&gt;:mapping option&lt;/tt&gt;, as arguments and uses them to instantiate a &lt;tt&gt;:class_name&lt;/tt&gt; object.
      #   The default is &lt;tt&gt;:new&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # * &lt;tt&gt;:converter&lt;/tt&gt; - A symbol specifying the name of a class method of &lt;tt&gt;:class_name&lt;/tt&gt; or a Proc that is
      #   called when a new value is assigned to the value object. The converter is passed the single value that is used
      #   in the assignment and is only called if the new value is not an instance of &lt;tt&gt;:class_name&lt;/tt&gt;.
      #
      # Option examples:
      #   composed_of :temperature, :mapping =&gt; %w(reading celsius)
      #   composed_of :balance, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Money&quot;, :mapping =&gt; %w(balance amount), :converter =&gt; Proc.new { |balance| balance.to_money }
      #   composed_of :address, :mapping =&gt; [ %w(address_street street), %w(address_city city) ]
      #   composed_of :gps_location
      #   composed_of :gps_location, :allow_nil =&gt; true
      #   composed_of :ip_address,
      #               :class_name =&gt; 'IPAddr',
      #               :mapping =&gt; %w(ip to_i),
      #               :constructor =&gt; Proc.new { |ip| IPAddr.new(ip, Socket::AF_INET) },
      #               :converter =&gt; Proc.new { |ip| ip.is_a?(Integer) ? IPAddr.new(ip, Socket::AF_INET) : IPAddr.new(ip.to_s) }
