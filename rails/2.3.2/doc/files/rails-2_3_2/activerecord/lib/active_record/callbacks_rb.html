module ActiveRecord
  # Callbacks are hooks into the lifecycle of an Active Record object that allow you to trigger logic
  # before or after an alteration of the object state. This can be used to make sure that associated and
  # dependent objects are deleted when +destroy+ is called (by overwriting +before_destroy+) or to massage attributes
  # before they're validated (by overwriting +before_validation+). As an example of the callbacks initiated, consider
  # the &lt;tt&gt;Base#save&lt;/tt&gt; call for a new record:
  #
  # * (-) &lt;tt&gt;save&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (-) &lt;tt&gt;valid&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (1) &lt;tt&gt;before_validation&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (2) &lt;tt&gt;before_validation_on_create&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (-) &lt;tt&gt;validate&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (-) &lt;tt&gt;validate_on_create&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (3) &lt;tt&gt;after_validation&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (4) &lt;tt&gt;after_validation_on_create&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (5) &lt;tt&gt;before_save&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (6) &lt;tt&gt;before_create&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (-) &lt;tt&gt;create&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (7) &lt;tt&gt;after_create&lt;/tt&gt;
  # * (8) &lt;tt&gt;after_save&lt;/tt&gt;
  #
  # That's a total of eight callbacks, which gives you immense power to react and prepare for each state in the
  # Active Record lifecycle. The sequence for calling &lt;tt&gt;Base#save&lt;/tt&gt; an existing record is similar, except that each 
  # &lt;tt&gt;_on_create&lt;/tt&gt; callback is replaced by the corresponding &lt;tt&gt;_on_update&lt;/tt&gt; callback.
  #
  # Examples:
  #   class CreditCard &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     # Strip everything but digits, so the user can specify &quot;555 234 34&quot; or
  #     # &quot;5552-3434&quot; or both will mean &quot;55523434&quot;
  #     def before_validation_on_create
  #       self.number = number.gsub(/[^0-9]/, &quot;&quot;) if attribute_present?(&quot;number&quot;)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   class Subscription &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     before_create :record_signup
  #
  #     private
  #       def record_signup
  #         self.signed_up_on = Date.today
  #       end
  #   end
  #
  #   class Firm &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     # Destroys the associated clients and people when the firm is destroyed
  #     before_destroy { |record| Person.destroy_all &quot;firm_id = #{record.id}&quot;   }
  #     before_destroy { |record| Client.destroy_all &quot;client_of = #{record.id}&quot; }
  #   end
  #
  # == Inheritable callback queues
  #
  # Besides the overwritable callback methods, it's also possible to register callbacks through the use of the callback macros.
  # Their main advantage is that the macros add behavior into a callback queue that is kept intact down through an inheritance
  # hierarchy. Example:
  #
  #   class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     before_destroy :destroy_author
  #   end
  #
  #   class Reply &lt; Topic
  #     before_destroy :destroy_readers
  #   end
  #
  # Now, when &lt;tt&gt;Topic#destroy&lt;/tt&gt; is run only +destroy_author+ is called. When &lt;tt&gt;Reply#destroy&lt;/tt&gt; is run, both +destroy_author+ and
  # +destroy_readers+ are called. Contrast this to the situation where we've implemented the save behavior through overwriteable
  # methods:
  #
  #   class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     def before_destroy() destroy_author end
  #   end
  #
  #   class Reply &lt; Topic
  #     def before_destroy() destroy_readers end
  #   end
  #
  # In that case, &lt;tt&gt;Reply#destroy&lt;/tt&gt; would only run +destroy_readers+ and _not_ +destroy_author+. So, use the callback macros when
  # you want to ensure that a certain callback is called for the entire hierarchy, and use the regular overwriteable methods
  # when you want to leave it up to each descendant to decide whether they want to call +super+ and trigger the inherited callbacks.
  #
  # *IMPORTANT:* In order for inheritance to work for the callback queues, you must specify the callbacks before specifying the
  # associations. Otherwise, you might trigger the loading of a child before the parent has registered the callbacks and they won't
  # be inherited.
  #
  # == Types of callbacks
  #
  # There are four types of callbacks accepted by the callback macros: Method references (symbol), callback objects,
  # inline methods (using a proc), and inline eval methods (using a string). Method references and callback objects are the
  # recommended approaches, inline methods using a proc are sometimes appropriate (such as for creating mix-ins), and inline
  # eval methods are deprecated.
  #
  # The method reference callbacks work by specifying a protected or private method available in the object, like this:
  #
  #   class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     before_destroy :delete_parents
  #
  #     private
  #       def delete_parents
  #         self.class.delete_all &quot;parent_id = #{id}&quot;
  #       end
  #   end
  #
  # The callback objects have methods named after the callback called with the record as the only parameter, such as:
  #
  #   class BankAccount &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     before_save      EncryptionWrapper.new
  #     after_save       EncryptionWrapper.new
  #     after_initialize EncryptionWrapper.new
  #   end
  #
  #   class EncryptionWrapper
  #     def before_save(record)
  #       record.credit_card_number = encrypt(record.credit_card_number)
  #     end
  #
  #     def after_save(record)
  #       record.credit_card_number = decrypt(record.credit_card_number)
  #     end
  #
  #     alias_method :after_find, :after_save
  #
  #     private
  #       def encrypt(value)
  #         # Secrecy is committed
  #       end
  #
  #       def decrypt(value)
  #         # Secrecy is unveiled
  #       end
  #   end
  #
  # So you specify the object you want messaged on a given callback. When that callback is triggered, the object has
  # a method by the name of the callback messaged. You can make these callbacks more flexible by passing in other
  # initialization data such as the name of the attribute to work with:
  #
  #   class BankAccount &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     before_save      EncryptionWrapper.new(&quot;credit_card_number&quot;)
  #     after_save       EncryptionWrapper.new(&quot;credit_card_number&quot;)
  #     after_initialize EncryptionWrapper.new(&quot;credit_card_number&quot;)
  #   end
  #
  #   class EncryptionWrapper
  #     def initialize(attribute)
  #       @attribute = attribute
  #     end
  #
  #     def before_save(record)
  #       record.send(&quot;#{@attribute}=&quot;, encrypt(record.send(&quot;#{@attribute}&quot;)))
  #     end
  #
  #     def after_save(record)
  #       record.send(&quot;#{@attribute}=&quot;, decrypt(record.send(&quot;#{@attribute}&quot;)))
  #     end
  #
  #     alias_method :after_find, :after_save
  #
  #     private
  #       def encrypt(value)
  #         # Secrecy is committed
  #       end
  #
  #       def decrypt(value)
  #         # Secrecy is unveiled
  #       end
  #   end
  #
  # The callback macros usually accept a symbol for the method they're supposed to run, but you can also pass a &quot;method string&quot;,
  # which will then be evaluated within the binding of the callback. Example:
  #
  #   class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     before_destroy 'self.class.delete_all &quot;parent_id = #{id}&quot;'
  #   end
  #
  # Notice that single quotes (') are used so the &lt;tt&gt;#{id}&lt;/tt&gt; part isn't evaluated until the callback is triggered. Also note that these
  # inline callbacks can be stacked just like the regular ones:
  #
  #   class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #     before_destroy 'self.class.delete_all &quot;parent_id = #{id}&quot;',
  #                    'puts &quot;Evaluated after parents are destroyed&quot;'
  #   end
  #
  # == The +after_find+ and +after_initialize+ exceptions
  #
  # Because +after_find+ and +after_initialize+ are called for each object found and instantiated by a finder, such as &lt;tt&gt;Base.find(:all)&lt;/tt&gt;, we've had
  # to implement a simple performance constraint (50% more speed on a simple test case). Unlike all the other callbacks, +after_find+ and
  # +after_initialize+ will only be run if an explicit implementation is defined (&lt;tt&gt;def after_find&lt;/tt&gt;). In that case, all of the
  # callback types will be called.
  #
  # == &lt;tt&gt;before_validation*&lt;/tt&gt; returning statements
  #
  # If the returning value of a +before_validation+ callback can be evaluated to +false+, the process will be aborted and &lt;tt&gt;Base#save&lt;/tt&gt; will return +false+.
  # If Base#save! is called it will raise a ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid exception.
  # Nothing will be appended to the errors object.
  #
  # == Canceling callbacks
  #
  # If a &lt;tt&gt;before_*&lt;/tt&gt; callback returns +false+, all the later callbacks and the associated action are cancelled. If an &lt;tt&gt;after_*&lt;/tt&gt; callback returns
  # +false+, all the later callbacks are cancelled. Callbacks are generally run in the order they are defined, with the exception of callbacks
  # defined as methods on the model, which are called last.
  #
  # == Transactions
  #
  # The entire callback chain of a +save+, &lt;tt&gt;save!&lt;/tt&gt;, or +destroy+ call runs
  # within a transaction. That includes &lt;tt&gt;after_*&lt;/tt&gt; hooks. If everything
  # goes fine a COMMIT is executed once the chain has been completed.
  #
  # If a &lt;tt&gt;before_*&lt;/tt&gt; callback cancels the action a ROLLBACK is issued. You
  # can also trigger a ROLLBACK raising an exception in any of the callbacks,
  # including &lt;tt&gt;after_*&lt;/tt&gt; hooks. Note, however, that in that case the client
  # needs to be aware of it because an ordinary +save+ will raise such exception
  # instead of quietly returning +false+.
