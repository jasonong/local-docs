  module Associations
    # This is the root class of all association proxies:
    #
    #   AssociationProxy
    #     BelongsToAssociation
    #       HasOneAssociation
    #     BelongsToPolymorphicAssociation
    #     AssociationCollection
    #       HasAndBelongsToManyAssociation
    #       HasManyAssociation
    #         HasManyThroughAssociation
    #            HasOneThroughAssociation
    #
    # Association proxies in Active Record are middlemen between the object that
    # holds the association, known as the &lt;tt&gt;@owner&lt;/tt&gt;, and the actual associated
    # object, known as the &lt;tt&gt;@target&lt;/tt&gt;. The kind of association any proxy is
    # about is available in &lt;tt&gt;@reflection&lt;/tt&gt;. That's an instance of the class
    # ActiveRecord::Reflection::AssociationReflection.
    #
    # For example, given
    #
    #   class Blog &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :posts
    #   end
    #
    #   blog = Blog.find(:first)
    #
    # the association proxy in &lt;tt&gt;blog.posts&lt;/tt&gt; has the object in +blog+ as
    # &lt;tt&gt;@owner&lt;/tt&gt;, the collection of its posts as &lt;tt&gt;@target&lt;/tt&gt;, and
    # the &lt;tt&gt;@reflection&lt;/tt&gt; object represents a &lt;tt&gt;:has_many&lt;/tt&gt; macro.
    #
    # This class has most of the basic instance methods removed, and delegates
    # unknown methods to &lt;tt&gt;@target&lt;/tt&gt; via &lt;tt&gt;method_missing&lt;/tt&gt;. As a
    # corner case, it even removes the +class+ method and that's why you get
    #
    #   blog.posts.class # =&gt; Array
    #
    # though the object behind &lt;tt&gt;blog.posts&lt;/tt&gt; is not an Array, but an
    # ActiveRecord::Associations::HasManyAssociation.
    #
    # The &lt;tt&gt;@target&lt;/tt&gt; object is not \loaded until needed. For example,
    #
    #   blog.posts.count
    #
    # is computed directly through SQL and does not trigger by itself the
    # instantiation of the actual post records.
