    # Associations are a set of macro-like class methods for tying objects together through foreign keys. They express relationships like
    # &quot;Project has one Project Manager&quot; or &quot;Project belongs to a Portfolio&quot;. Each macro adds a number of methods to the class which are
    # specialized according to the collection or association symbol and the options hash. It works much the same way as Ruby's own &lt;tt&gt;attr*&lt;/tt&gt;
    # methods. Example:
    #
    #   class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to              :portfolio
    #     has_one                 :project_manager
    #     has_many                :milestones
    #     has_and_belongs_to_many :categories
    #   end
    #
    # The project class now has the following methods (and more) to ease the traversal and manipulation of its relationships:
    # * &lt;tt&gt;Project#portfolio, Project#portfolio=(portfolio), Project#portfolio.nil?&lt;/tt&gt;
    # * &lt;tt&gt;Project#project_manager, Project#project_manager=(project_manager), Project#project_manager.nil?,&lt;/tt&gt;
    # * &lt;tt&gt;Project#milestones.empty?, Project#milestones.size, Project#milestones, Project#milestones&lt;&lt;(milestone),&lt;/tt&gt;
    #   &lt;tt&gt;Project#milestones.delete(milestone), Project#milestones.find(milestone_id), Project#milestones.find(:all, options),&lt;/tt&gt;
    #   &lt;tt&gt;Project#milestones.build, Project#milestones.create&lt;/tt&gt;
    # * &lt;tt&gt;Project#categories.empty?, Project#categories.size, Project#categories, Project#categories&lt;&lt;(category1),&lt;/tt&gt;
    #   &lt;tt&gt;Project#categories.delete(category1)&lt;/tt&gt;
    #
    # === A word of warning
    #
    # Don't create associations that have the same name as instance methods of ActiveRecord::Base. Since the association
    # adds a method with that name to its model, it will override the inherited method and break things.
    # For instance, +attributes+ and +connection+ would be bad choices for association names.

    #
    # == Cardinality and associations
    #
    # Active Record associations can be used to describe one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many
    # relationships between models. Each model uses an association to describe its role in
    # the relation. The +belongs_to+ association is always used in the model that has
    # the foreign key.
    #
    # === One-to-one
    #
    # Use +has_one+ in the base, and +belongs_to+ in the associated model.
    #
    #   class Employee &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_one :office
    #   end
    #   class Office &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :employee    # foreign key - employee_id
    #   end
    #
    # === One-to-many
    #
    # Use +has_many+ in the base, and +belongs_to+ in the associated model.
    #
    #   class Manager &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :employees
    #   end
    #   class Employee &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :manager     # foreign key - manager_id
    #   end
    #
    # === Many-to-many
    #
    # There are two ways to build a many-to-many relationship.
    #
    # The first way uses a +has_many+ association with the &lt;tt&gt;:through&lt;/tt&gt; option and a join model, so
    # there are two stages of associations.
    #
    #   class Assignment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :programmer  # foreign key - programmer_id
    #     belongs_to :project     # foreign key - project_id
    #   end
    #   class Programmer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :assignments
    #     has_many :projects, :through =&gt; :assignments
    #   end
    #   class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :assignments
    #     has_many :programmers, :through =&gt; :assignments
    #   end
    #
    # For the second way, use +has_and_belongs_to_many+ in both models. This requires a join table
    # that has no corresponding model or primary key.
    #
    #   class Programmer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_and_belongs_to_many :projects       # foreign keys in the join table
    #   end
    #   class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_and_belongs_to_many :programmers    # foreign keys in the join table
    #   end
    #
    # Choosing which way to build a many-to-many relationship is not always simple.
    # If you need to work with the relationship model as its own entity,
    # use &lt;tt&gt;has_many :through&lt;/tt&gt;. Use +has_and_belongs_to_many+ when working with legacy schemas or when
    # you never work directly with the relationship itself.
    #
    # == Is it a +belongs_to+ or +has_one+ association?
    #
    # Both express a 1-1 relationship. The difference is mostly where to place the foreign key, which goes on the table for the class
    # declaring the +belongs_to+ relationship. Example:
    #
    #   class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     # I reference an account.
    #     belongs_to :account
    #   end
    #
    #   class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     # One user references me.
    #     has_one :user
    #   end
    #
    # The tables for these classes could look something like:
    #
    #   CREATE TABLE users (
    #     id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
    #     account_id int(11) default NULL,
    #     name varchar default NULL,
    #     PRIMARY KEY  (id)
    #   )
    #
    #   CREATE TABLE accounts (
    #     id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
    #     name varchar default NULL,
    #     PRIMARY KEY  (id)
    #   )
    #
    # == Unsaved objects and associations
    #
    # You can manipulate objects and associations before they are saved to the database, but there is some special behavior you should be
    # aware of, mostly involving the saving of associated objects.
    #
    # Unless you enable the :autosave option on a &lt;tt&gt;has_one&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to&lt;/tt&gt;,
    # &lt;tt&gt;has_many&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;has_and_belongs_to_many&lt;/tt&gt; association,
    # in which case the members are always saved.
    #
    # === One-to-one associations
    #
    # * Assigning an object to a +has_one+ association automatically saves that object and the object being replaced (if there is one), in
    #   order to update their primary keys - except if the parent object is unsaved (&lt;tt&gt;new_record? == true&lt;/tt&gt;).
    # * If either of these saves fail (due to one of the objects being invalid) the assignment statement returns +false+ and the assignment
    #   is cancelled.
    # * If you wish to assign an object to a +has_one+ association without saving it, use the &lt;tt&gt;association.build&lt;/tt&gt; method (documented below).
    # * Assigning an object to a +belongs_to+ association does not save the object, since the foreign key field belongs on the parent. It
    #   does not save the parent either.
    #
    # === Collections
    #
    # * Adding an object to a collection (+has_many+ or +has_and_belongs_to_many+) automatically saves that object, except if the parent object
    #   (the owner of the collection) is not yet stored in the database.
    # * If saving any of the objects being added to a collection (via &lt;tt&gt;push&lt;/tt&gt; or similar) fails, then &lt;tt&gt;push&lt;/tt&gt; returns +false+.
    # * You can add an object to a collection without automatically saving it by using the &lt;tt&gt;collection.build&lt;/tt&gt; method (documented below).
    # * All unsaved (&lt;tt&gt;new_record? == true&lt;/tt&gt;) members of the collection are automatically saved when the parent is saved.
    #
    # === Association callbacks
    #
    # Similar to the normal callbacks that hook into the lifecycle of an Active Record object, you can also define callbacks that get
    # triggered when you add an object to or remove an object from an association collection. Example:
    #
    #   class Project
    #     has_and_belongs_to_many :developers, :after_add =&gt; :evaluate_velocity
    #
    #     def evaluate_velocity(developer)
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # It's possible to stack callbacks by passing them as an array. Example:
    #
    #   class Project
    #     has_and_belongs_to_many :developers, :after_add =&gt; [:evaluate_velocity, Proc.new { |p, d| p.shipping_date = Time.now}]
    #   end
    #
    # Possible callbacks are: +before_add+, +after_add+, +before_remove+ and +after_remove+.
    #
    # Should any of the +before_add+ callbacks throw an exception, the object does not get added to the collection. Same with
    # the +before_remove+ callbacks; if an exception is thrown the object doesn't get removed.
    #
    # === Association extensions
    #
    # The proxy objects that control the access to associations can be extended through anonymous modules. This is especially
    # beneficial for adding new finders, creators, and other factory-type methods that are only used as part of this association.
    # Example:
    #
    #   class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :people do
    #       def find_or_create_by_name(name)
    #         first_name, last_name = name.split(&quot; &quot;, 2)
    #         find_or_create_by_first_name_and_last_name(first_name, last_name)
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   person = Account.find(:first).people.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;David Heinemeier Hansson&quot;)
    #   person.first_name # =&gt; &quot;David&quot;
    #   person.last_name  # =&gt; &quot;Heinemeier Hansson&quot;
    #
    # If you need to share the same extensions between many associations, you can use a named extension module. Example:
    #
    #   module FindOrCreateByNameExtension
    #     def find_or_create_by_name(name)
    #       first_name, last_name = name.split(&quot; &quot;, 2)
    #       find_or_create_by_first_name_and_last_name(first_name, last_name)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :people, :extend =&gt; FindOrCreateByNameExtension
    #   end
    #
    #   class Company &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :people, :extend =&gt; FindOrCreateByNameExtension
    #   end
    #
    # If you need to use multiple named extension modules, you can specify an array of modules with the &lt;tt&gt;:extend&lt;/tt&gt; option.
    # In the case of name conflicts between methods in the modules, methods in modules later in the array supercede
    # those earlier in the array. Example:
    #
    #   class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :people, :extend =&gt; [FindOrCreateByNameExtension, FindRecentExtension]
    #   end
    #
    # Some extensions can only be made to work with knowledge of the association proxy's internals.
    # Extensions can access relevant state using accessors on the association proxy:
    #
    # * +proxy_owner+ - Returns the object the association is part of.
    # * +proxy_reflection+ - Returns the reflection object that describes the association.
    # * +proxy_target+ - Returns the associated object for +belongs_to+ and +has_one+, or the collection of associated objects for +has_many+ and +has_and_belongs_to_many+.
    #
    # === Association Join Models
    #
    # Has Many associations can be configured with the &lt;tt&gt;:through&lt;/tt&gt; option to use an explicit join model to retrieve the data.  This
    # operates similarly to a +has_and_belongs_to_many+ association.  The advantage is that you're able to add validations,
    # callbacks, and extra attributes on the join model.  Consider the following schema:
    #
    #   class Author &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :authorships
    #     has_many :books, :through =&gt; :authorships
    #   end
    #
    #   class Authorship &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :author
    #     belongs_to :book
    #   end
    #
    #   @author = Author.find :first
    #   @author.authorships.collect { |a| a.book } # selects all books that the author's authorships belong to.
    #   @author.books                              # selects all books by using the Authorship join model
    #
    # You can also go through a +has_many+ association on the join model:
    #
    #   class Firm &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many   :clients
    #     has_many   :invoices, :through =&gt; :clients
    #   end
    #
    #   class Client &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :firm
    #     has_many   :invoices
    #   end
    #
    #   class Invoice &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :client
    #   end
    #
    #   @firm = Firm.find :first
    #   @firm.clients.collect { |c| c.invoices }.flatten # select all invoices for all clients of the firm
    #   @firm.invoices                                   # selects all invoices by going through the Client join model.
    #
    # === Polymorphic Associations
    #
    # Polymorphic associations on models are not restricted on what types of models they can be associated with.  Rather, they
    # specify an interface that a +has_many+ association must adhere to.
    #
    #   class Asset &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic =&gt; true
    #   end
    #
    #   class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :assets, :as =&gt; :attachable         # The :as option specifies the polymorphic interface to use.
    #   end
    #
    #   @asset.attachable = @post
    #
    # This works by using a type column in addition to a foreign key to specify the associated record.  In the Asset example, you'd need
    # an +attachable_id+ integer column and an +attachable_type+ string column.
    #
    # Using polymorphic associations in combination with single table inheritance (STI) is a little tricky. In order
    # for the associations to work as expected, ensure that you store the base model for the STI models in the
    # type column of the polymorphic association. To continue with the asset example above, suppose there are guest posts
    # and member posts that use the posts table for STI. In this case, there must be a +type+ column in the posts table.
    #
    #   class Asset &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :attachable, :polymorphic =&gt; true
    #
    #     def attachable_type=(sType)
    #        super(sType.to_s.classify.constantize.base_class.to_s)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     # because we store &quot;Post&quot; in attachable_type now :dependent =&gt; :destroy will work
    #     has_many :assets, :as =&gt; :attachable, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
    #   end
    #
    #   class GuestPost &lt; Post
    #   end
    #
    #   class MemberPost &lt; Post
    #   end
    #
    # == Caching
    #
    # All of the methods are built on a simple caching principle that will keep the result of the last query around unless specifically
    # instructed not to. The cache is even shared across methods to make it even cheaper to use the macro-added methods without
    # worrying too much about performance at the first go. Example:
    #
    #   project.milestones             # fetches milestones from the database
    #   project.milestones.size        # uses the milestone cache
    #   project.milestones.empty?      # uses the milestone cache
    #   project.milestones(true).size  # fetches milestones from the database
    #   project.milestones             # uses the milestone cache
    #
    # == Eager loading of associations
    #
    # Eager loading is a way to find objects of a certain class and a number of named associations. This is
    # one of the easiest ways of to prevent the dreaded 1+N problem in which fetching 100 posts that each need to display their author
    # triggers 101 database queries. Through the use of eager loading, the 101 queries can be reduced to 2. Example:
    #
    #   class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :author
    #     has_many   :comments
    #   end
    #
    # Consider the following loop using the class above:
    #
    #   for post in Post.all
    #     puts &quot;Post:            &quot; + post.title
    #     puts &quot;Written by:      &quot; + post.author.name
    #     puts &quot;Last comment on: &quot; + post.comments.first.created_on
    #   end
    #
    # To iterate over these one hundred posts, we'll generate 201 database queries. Let's first just optimize it for retrieving the author:
    #
    #   for post in Post.find(:all, :include =&gt; :author)
    #
    # This references the name of the +belongs_to+ association that also used the &lt;tt&gt;:author&lt;/tt&gt; symbol. After loading the posts, find
    # will collect the +author_id+ from each one and load all the referenced authors with one query. Doing so will cut down the number of queries from 201 to 102.
    #
    # We can improve upon the situation further by referencing both associations in the finder with:
    #
    #   for post in Post.find(:all, :include =&gt; [ :author, :comments ])
    #
    # This will load all comments with a single query. This reduces the total number of queries to 3. More generally the number of queries
    # will be 1 plus the number of associations named (except if some of the associations are polymorphic +belongs_to+ - see below).
    #
    # To include a deep hierarchy of associations, use a hash:
    #
    #   for post in Post.find(:all, :include =&gt; [ :author, { :comments =&gt; { :author =&gt; :gravatar } } ])
    #
    # That'll grab not only all the comments but all their authors and gravatar pictures.  You can mix and match
    # symbols, arrays and hashes in any combination to describe the associations you want to load.
    #
    # All of this power shouldn't fool you into thinking that you can pull out huge amounts of data with no performance penalty just because you've reduced
    # the number of queries. The database still needs to send all the data to Active Record and it still needs to be processed. So it's no
    # catch-all for performance problems, but it's a great way to cut down on the number of queries in a situation as the one described above.
    #
    # Since only one table is loaded at a time, conditions or orders cannot reference tables other than the main one. If this is the case
    # Active Record falls back to the previously used LEFT OUTER JOIN based strategy. For example
    #  
    #   Post.find(:all, :include =&gt; [ :author, :comments ], :conditions =&gt; ['comments.approved = ?', true])
    #
    # will result in a single SQL query with joins along the lines of: &lt;tt&gt;LEFT OUTER JOIN comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id&lt;/tt&gt; and
    # &lt;tt&gt;LEFT OUTER JOIN authors ON authors.id = posts.author_id&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that using conditions like this can have unintended consequences.
    # In the above example posts with no approved comments are not returned at all, because the conditions apply to the SQL statement as a whole
    # and not just to the association. You must disambiguate column references for this fallback to happen, for example
    # &lt;tt&gt;:order =&gt; &quot;author.name DESC&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; will work but &lt;tt&gt;:order =&gt; &quot;name DESC&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; will not. 
    #
    # If you do want eagerload only some members of an association it is usually more natural to &lt;tt&gt;:include&lt;/tt&gt; an association
    # which has conditions defined on it:
    #
    #   class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :approved_comments, :class_name =&gt; 'Comment', :conditions =&gt; ['approved = ?', true]
    #   end
    #
    #   Post.find(:all, :include =&gt; :approved_comments)
    #
    # will load posts and eager load the +approved_comments+ association, which contains only those comments that have been approved.
    #
    # If you eager load an association with a specified &lt;tt&gt;:limit&lt;/tt&gt; option, it will be ignored, returning all the associated objects:
    #
    #   class Picture &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     has_many :most_recent_comments, :class_name =&gt; 'Comment', :order =&gt; 'id DESC', :limit =&gt; 10
    #   end
    #
    #   Picture.find(:first, :include =&gt; :most_recent_comments).most_recent_comments # =&gt; returns all associated comments.
    #
    # When eager loaded, conditions are interpolated in the context of the model class, not the model instance.  Conditions are lazily interpolated
    # before the actual model exists.
    #
    # Eager loading is supported with polymorphic associations.
    #
    #   class Address &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #     belongs_to :addressable, :polymorphic =&gt; true
    #   end
    #
    # A call that tries to eager load the addressable model
    #
    #   Address.find(:all, :include =&gt; :addressable)
    #
    # will execute one query to load the addresses and load the addressables with one query per addressable type. 
    # For example if all the addressables are either of class Person or Company then a total of 3 queries will be executed. The list of
    # addressable types to load is determined on the back of the addresses loaded. This is not supported if Active Record has to fallback
    # to the previous implementation of eager loading and will raise ActiveRecord::EagerLoadPolymorphicError. The reason is that the parent 
    # model's type is a column value so its corresponding table name cannot be put in the +FROM+/+JOIN+ clauses of that query.
    #
    # == Table Aliasing
    #
    # Active Record uses table aliasing in the case that a table is referenced multiple times in a join.  If a table is referenced only once,
    # the standard table name is used.  The second time, the table is aliased as &lt;tt&gt;#{reflection_name}_#{parent_table_name}&lt;/tt&gt;.  Indexes are appended
    # for any more successive uses of the table name.
    #
    #   Post.find :all, :joins =&gt; :comments
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON ...
    #   Post.find :all, :joins =&gt; :special_comments # STI
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON ... AND comments.type = 'SpecialComment'
    #   Post.find :all, :joins =&gt; [:comments, :special_comments] # special_comments is the reflection name, posts is the parent table name
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON ... INNER JOIN comments special_comments_posts
    #
    # Acts as tree example:
    #
    #   TreeMixin.find :all, :joins =&gt; :children
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM mixins INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins ...
    #   TreeMixin.find :all, :joins =&gt; {:children =&gt; :parent}
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM mixins INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins ...
    #                               INNER JOIN parents_mixins ...
    #   TreeMixin.find :all, :joins =&gt; {:children =&gt; {:parent =&gt; :children}}
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM mixins INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins ...
    #                               INNER JOIN parents_mixins ...
    #                               INNER JOIN mixins childrens_mixins_2
    #
    # Has and Belongs to Many join tables use the same idea, but add a &lt;tt&gt;_join&lt;/tt&gt; suffix:
    #
    #   Post.find :all, :joins =&gt; :categories
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN categories_posts ... INNER JOIN categories ...
    #   Post.find :all, :joins =&gt; {:categories =&gt; :posts}
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN categories_posts ... INNER JOIN categories ...
    #                              INNER JOIN categories_posts posts_categories_join INNER JOIN posts posts_categories
    #   Post.find :all, :joins =&gt; {:categories =&gt; {:posts =&gt; :categories}}
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN categories_posts ... INNER JOIN categories ...
    #                              INNER JOIN categories_posts posts_categories_join INNER JOIN posts posts_categories
    #                              INNER JOIN categories_posts categories_posts_join INNER JOIN categories categories_posts_2
    #
    # If you wish to specify your own custom joins using a &lt;tt&gt;:joins&lt;/tt&gt; option, those table names will take precedence over the eager associations:
    #
    #   Post.find :all, :joins =&gt; :comments, :joins =&gt; &quot;inner join comments ...&quot;
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments_posts ON ... INNER JOIN comments ...
    #   Post.find :all, :joins =&gt; [:comments, :special_comments], :joins =&gt; &quot;inner join comments ...&quot;
    #   # =&gt; SELECT ... FROM posts INNER JOIN comments comments_posts ON ...
    #                              INNER JOIN comments special_comments_posts ...
    #                              INNER JOIN comments ...
    #
    # Table aliases are automatically truncated according to the maximum length of table identifiers according to the specific database.
    #
    # == Modules
    #
    # By default, associations will look for objects within the current module scope. Consider:
    #
    #   module MyApplication
    #     module Business
    #       class Firm &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #          has_many :clients
    #        end
    #
    #       class Client &lt; ActiveRecord::Base; end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # When &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients&lt;/tt&gt; is called, it will in turn call &lt;tt&gt;MyApplication::Business::Client.find_all_by_firm_id(firm.id)&lt;/tt&gt;.
    # If you want to associate with a class in another module scope, this can be done by specifying the complete class name.
    # Example:
    #
    #   module MyApplication
    #     module Business
    #       class Firm &lt; ActiveRecord::Base; end
    #     end
    #
    #     module Billing
    #       class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    #         belongs_to :firm, :class_name =&gt; &quot;MyApplication::Business::Firm&quot;
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # == Type safety with &lt;tt&gt;ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch&lt;/tt&gt;
    #
    # If you attempt to assign an object to an association that doesn't match the inferred or specified &lt;tt&gt;:class_name&lt;/tt&gt;, you'll
    # get an &lt;tt&gt;ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch&lt;/tt&gt;.
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # All of the association macros can be specialized through options. This makes cases more complex than the simple and guessable ones
    # possible.
    module ClassMethods
      # Specifies a one-to-many association. The following methods for retrieval and query of
      # collections of associated objects will be added:
      #
      # [collection(force_reload = false)]
      #   Returns an array of all the associated objects.
      #   An empty array is returned if none are found.
      # [collection&lt;&lt;(object, ...)]
      #   Adds one or more objects to the collection by setting their foreign keys to the collection's primary key.
      # [collection.delete(object, ...)]
      #   Removes one or more objects from the collection by setting their foreign keys to +NULL+.
      #   Objects will be in addition destroyed if they're associated with &lt;tt&gt;:dependent =&gt; :destroy&lt;/tt&gt;,
      #   and deleted if they're associated with &lt;tt&gt;:dependent =&gt; :delete_all&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [collection=objects]
      #   Replaces the collections content by deleting and adding objects as appropriate.
      # [collection_singular_ids]
      #   Returns an array of the associated objects' ids
      # [collection_singular_ids=ids]
      #   Replace the collection with the objects identified by the primary keys in +ids+
      # [collection.clear]
      #   Removes every object from the collection. This destroys the associated objects if they
      #   are associated with &lt;tt&gt;:dependent =&gt; :destroy&lt;/tt&gt;, deletes them directly from the
      #   database if &lt;tt&gt;:dependent =&gt; :delete_all&lt;/tt&gt;, otherwise sets their foreign keys to +NULL+.
      # [collection.empty?]
      #   Returns +true+ if there are no associated objects.
      # [collection.size]
      #   Returns the number of associated objects.
      # [collection.find(...)]
      #   Finds an associated object according to the same rules as ActiveRecord::Base.find.
      # [collection.exists?(...)]
      #   Checks whether an associated object with the given conditions exists.
      #   Uses the same rules as ActiveRecord::Base.exists?.
      # [collection.build(attributes = {}, ...)]
      #   Returns one or more new objects of the collection type that have been instantiated
      #   with +attributes+ and linked to this object through a foreign key, but have not yet
      #   been saved. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; This only works if an associated object already exists, not if
      #   it's +nil+!
      # [collection.create(attributes = {})]
      #   Returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated
      #   with +attributes+, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that has already
      #   been saved (if it passed the validation). &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; This only works if an associated
      #   object already exists, not if it's +nil+!
      #
      # (*Note*: +collection+ is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument, so
      # &lt;tt&gt;has_many :clients&lt;/tt&gt; would add among others &lt;tt&gt;clients.empty?&lt;/tt&gt;.)
      #
      # === Example
      #
      # Example: A Firm class declares &lt;tt&gt;has_many :clients&lt;/tt&gt;, which will add:
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;Clients.find :all, :conditions =&gt; [&quot;firm_id = ?&quot;, id]&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients.delete&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients=&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#client_ids&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#client_ids=&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients.clear&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients.empty?&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;firm.clients.size == 0&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients.size&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;Client.count &quot;firm_id = #{id}&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients.find&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;Client.find(id, :conditions =&gt; &quot;firm_id = #{id}&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients.exists?(:name =&gt; 'ACME')&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;Client.exists?(:name =&gt; 'ACME', :firm_id =&gt; firm.id)&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients.build&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;Client.new(&quot;firm_id&quot; =&gt; id)&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Firm#clients.create&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;c = Client.new(&quot;firm_id&quot; =&gt; id); c.save; c&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
      #
      # === Supported options
      # [:class_name]
      #   Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred
      #   from the association name. So &lt;tt&gt;has_many :products&lt;/tt&gt; will by default be linked to the Product class, but
      #   if the real class name is SpecialProduct, you'll have to specify it with this option.
      # [:conditions]
      #   Specify the conditions that the associated objects must meet in order to be included as a +WHERE+
      #   SQL fragment, such as &lt;tt&gt;price &gt; 5 AND name LIKE 'B%'&lt;/tt&gt;.  Record creations from the association are scoped if a hash
      #   is used.  &lt;tt&gt;has_many :posts, :conditions =&gt; {:published =&gt; true}&lt;/tt&gt; will create published posts with &lt;tt&gt;@blog.posts.create&lt;/tt&gt;
      #   or &lt;tt&gt;@blog.posts.build&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:order]
      #   Specify the order in which the associated objects are returned as an &lt;tt&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/tt&gt; SQL fragment,
      #   such as &lt;tt&gt;last_name, first_name DESC&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:foreign_key]
      #   Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
      #   of this class in lower-case and &quot;_id&quot; suffixed. So a Person class that makes a +has_many+ association will use &quot;person_id&quot;
      #   as the default &lt;tt&gt;:foreign_key&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:primary_key]
      #   Specify the method that returns the primary key used for the association. By default this is +id+.
      # [:dependent]
      #   If set to &lt;tt&gt;:destroy&lt;/tt&gt; all the associated objects are destroyed
      #   alongside this object by calling their +destroy+ method.  If set to &lt;tt&gt;:delete_all&lt;/tt&gt; all associated
      #   objects are deleted *without* calling their +destroy+ method.  If set to &lt;tt&gt;:nullify&lt;/tt&gt; all associated
      #   objects' foreign keys are set to +NULL+ *without* calling their +save+ callbacks. *Warning:* This option is ignored when also using
      #   the &lt;tt&gt;:through&lt;/tt&gt; option.
      # [:finder_sql]
      #   Specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the association. This is a good way to go for complex
      #   associations that depend on multiple tables. Note: When this option is used, +find_in_collection+ is _not_ added.
      # [:counter_sql]
      #   Specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the size of the association. If &lt;tt&gt;:finder_sql&lt;/tt&gt; is
      #   specified but not &lt;tt&gt;:counter_sql&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;:counter_sql&lt;/tt&gt; will be generated by replacing &lt;tt&gt;SELECT ... FROM&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:extend]
      #   Specify a named module for extending the proxy. See &quot;Association extensions&quot;.
      # [:include]
      #   Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when the collection is loaded.
      # [:group]
      #   An attribute name by which the result should be grouped. Uses the &lt;tt&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/tt&gt; SQL-clause.
      # [:having]
      #   Combined with +:group+ this can be used to filter the records that a &lt;tt&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/tt&gt; returns. Uses the &lt;tt&gt;HAVING&lt;/tt&gt; SQL-clause.
      # [:limit]
      #   An integer determining the limit on the number of rows that should be returned.
      # [:offset]
      #   An integer determining the offset from where the rows should be fetched. So at 5, it would skip the first 4 rows.
      # [:select]
      #   By default, this is &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; as in &lt;tt&gt;SELECT * FROM&lt;/tt&gt;, but can be changed if you, for example, want to do a join
      #   but not include the joined columns. Do not forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise it will raise an error.
      # [:as]
      #   Specifies a polymorphic interface (See &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to&lt;/tt&gt;).
      # [:through]
      #   Specifies a Join Model through which to perform the query.  Options for &lt;tt&gt;:class_name&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;:foreign_key&lt;/tt&gt;

      #   Specifies the source association name used by &lt;tt&gt;has_many :through&lt;/tt&gt; queries.  Only use it if the name cannot be
      #   inferred from the association.  &lt;tt&gt;has_many :subscribers, :through =&gt; :subscriptions&lt;/tt&gt; will look for either &lt;tt&gt;:subscribers&lt;/tt&gt; or

      #   Specifies type of the source association used by &lt;tt&gt;has_many :through&lt;/tt&gt; queries where the source
      #   association is a polymorphic +belongs_to+.
      # [:uniq]
      #   If true, duplicates will be omitted from the collection. Useful in conjunction with &lt;tt&gt;:through&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:readonly]
      #   If true, all the associated objects are readonly through the association.
      # [:validate]
      #   If false, don't validate the associated objects when saving the parent object. true by default.

      # Specifies a one-to-one association with another class. This method should only be used
      # if the other class contains the foreign key. If the current class contains the foreign key,

      # on when to use has_one and when to use belongs_to.
      #
      # The following methods for retrieval and query of a single associated object will be added:
      #
      # [association(force_reload = false)]
      #   Returns the associated object. +nil+ is returned if none is found.
      # [association=(associate)]
      #   Assigns the associate object, extracts the primary key, sets it as the foreign key,
      #   and saves the associate object.
      # [build_association(attributes = {})]
      #   Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated
      #   with +attributes+ and linked to this object through a foreign key, but has not
      #   yet been saved. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; This ONLY works if an association already exists.
      #   It will NOT work if the association is +nil+.
      # [create_association(attributes = {})]
      #   Returns a new object of the associated type that has been instantiated
      #   with +attributes+, linked to this object through a foreign key, and that
      #   has already been saved (if it passed the validation).
      #
      # (+association+ is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument, so
      # &lt;tt&gt;has_one :manager&lt;/tt&gt; would add among others &lt;tt&gt;manager.nil?&lt;/tt&gt;.)
      #
      # === Example
      #
      # An Account class declares &lt;tt&gt;has_one :beneficiary&lt;/tt&gt;, which will add:
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Account#beneficiary&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;Beneficiary.find(:first, :conditions =&gt; &quot;account_id = #{id}&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Account#beneficiary=(beneficiary)&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;beneficiary.account_id = account.id; beneficiary.save&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Account#build_beneficiary&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;Beneficiary.new(&quot;account_id&quot; =&gt; id)&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Account#create_beneficiary&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;b = Beneficiary.new(&quot;account_id&quot; =&gt; id); b.save; b&lt;/tt&gt;)
      #
      # === Options
      #
      # The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
      #
      # Options are:
      # [:class_name]
      #   Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred
      #   from the association name. So &lt;tt&gt;has_one :manager&lt;/tt&gt; will by default be linked to the Manager class, but
      #   if the real class name is Person, you'll have to specify it with this option.
      # [:conditions]
      #   Specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be included as a +WHERE+
      #   SQL fragment, such as &lt;tt&gt;rank = 5&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:order]
      #   Specify the order in which the associated objects are returned as an &lt;tt&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/tt&gt; SQL fragment,
      #   such as &lt;tt&gt;last_name, first_name DESC&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:dependent]
      #   If set to &lt;tt&gt;:destroy&lt;/tt&gt;, the associated object is destroyed when this object is. If set to
      #   &lt;tt&gt;:delete&lt;/tt&gt;, the associated object is deleted *without* calling its destroy method. If set to &lt;tt&gt;:nullify&lt;/tt&gt;, the associated
      #   object's foreign key is set to +NULL+. Also, association is assigned.
      # [:foreign_key]
      #   Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
      #   of this class in lower-case and &quot;_id&quot; suffixed. So a Person class that makes a +has_one+ association will use &quot;person_id&quot;
      #   as the default &lt;tt&gt;:foreign_key&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:primary_key]
      #   Specify the method that returns the primary key used for the association. By default this is +id+.
      # [:include]
      #   Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when this object is loaded.
      # [:as]
      #   Specifies a polymorphic interface (See &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to&lt;/tt&gt;).
      # [:select]
      #   By default, this is &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; as in &lt;tt&gt;SELECT * FROM&lt;/tt&gt;, but can be changed if, for example, you want to do a join
      #   but not include the joined columns. Do not forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise it will raise an error.
      # [:through]
      #   Specifies a Join Model through which to perform the query.  Options for &lt;tt&gt;:class_name&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;:foreign_key&lt;/tt&gt;
      #   are ignored, as the association uses the source reflection. You can only use a &lt;tt&gt;:through&lt;/tt&gt; query through a 
      #   &lt;tt&gt;has_one&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to&lt;/tt&gt; association on the join model.
      # [:source]
      #   Specifies the source association name used by &lt;tt&gt;has_one :through&lt;/tt&gt; queries.  Only use it if the name cannot be
      #   inferred from the association.  &lt;tt&gt;has_one :favorite, :through =&gt; :favorites&lt;/tt&gt; will look for a
      #   &lt;tt&gt;:favorite&lt;/tt&gt; on Favorite, unless a &lt;tt&gt;:source&lt;/tt&gt; is given.
      # [:source_type]
      #   Specifies type of the source association used by &lt;tt&gt;has_one :through&lt;/tt&gt; queries where the source
      #   association is a polymorphic +belongs_to+.
      # [:readonly]
      #   If true, the associated object is readonly through the association.
      # [:validate]
      #   If false, don't validate the associated object when saving the parent object. +false+ by default.
      # [:autosave]
      #   If true, always save the associated object or destroy it if marked for destruction, when saving the parent object. Off by default.
      #
      # Option examples:
      #   has_one :credit_card, :dependent =&gt; :destroy  # destroys the associated credit card
      #   has_one :credit_card, :dependent =&gt; :nullify  # updates the associated records foreign key value to NULL rather than destroying it
      #   has_one :last_comment, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Comment&quot;, :order =&gt; &quot;posted_on&quot;
      #   has_one :project_manager, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Person&quot;, :conditions =&gt; &quot;role = 'project_manager'&quot;

      #
      # === Example
      #
      # A Post class declares &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to :author&lt;/tt&gt;, which will add:

      # * &lt;tt&gt;Post#author=(author)&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;post.author_id = author.id&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Post#author?&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;post.author == some_author&lt;/tt&gt;)

      # * &lt;tt&gt;Post#create_author&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;post.author = Author.new; post.author.save; post.author&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # The declaration can also include an options hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
      #
      # === Options
      #
      # [:class_name]
      #   Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred
      #   from the association name. So &lt;tt&gt;has_one :author&lt;/tt&gt; will by default be linked to the Author class, but
      #   if the real class name is Person, you'll have to specify it with this option.
      # [:conditions]
      #   Specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be included as a +WHERE+
      #   SQL fragment, such as &lt;tt&gt;authorized = 1&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:select]
      #   By default, this is &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; as in &lt;tt&gt;SELECT * FROM&lt;/tt&gt;, but can be changed if, for example, you want to do a join
      #   but not include the joined columns. Do not forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise it will raise an error.
      # [:foreign_key]
      #   Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
      #   of the association with an &quot;_id&quot; suffix. So a class that defines a &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to :person&lt;/tt&gt; association will use
      #   &quot;person_id&quot; as the default &lt;tt&gt;:foreign_key&lt;/tt&gt;. Similarly, &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to :favorite_person, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Person&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;
      #   will use a foreign key of &quot;favorite_person_id&quot;.
      # [:dependent]
      #   If set to &lt;tt&gt;:destroy&lt;/tt&gt;, the associated object is destroyed when this object is. If set to
      #   &lt;tt&gt;:delete&lt;/tt&gt;, the associated object is deleted *without* calling its destroy method. This option should not be specified when
      #   &lt;tt&gt;belongs_to&lt;/tt&gt; is used in conjunction with a &lt;tt&gt;has_many&lt;/tt&gt; relationship on another class because of the potential to leave
      #   orphaned records behind.
      # [:counter_cache]
      #   Caches the number of belonging objects on the associate class through the use of +increment_counter+
      #   and +decrement_counter+. The counter cache is incremented when an object of this class is created and decremented when it's
      #   destroyed. This requires that a column named &lt;tt&gt;#{table_name}_count&lt;/tt&gt; (such as +comments_count+ for a belonging Comment class)
      #   is used on the associate class (such as a Post class). You can also specify a custom counter cache column by providing
      #   a column name instead of a +true+/+false+ value to this option (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;:counter_cache =&gt; :my_custom_counter&lt;/tt&gt;.)
      #   Note: Specifying a counter cache will add it to that model's list of readonly attributes using +attr_readonly+.
      # [:include]
      #   Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when this object is loaded.
      # [:polymorphic]
      #   Specify this association is a polymorphic association by passing +true+.
      #   Note: If you've enabled the counter cache, then you may want to add the counter cache attribute
      #   to the +attr_readonly+ list in the associated classes (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;class Post; attr_readonly :comments_count; end&lt;/tt&gt;).
      # [:readonly]
      #   If true, the associated object is readonly through the association.
      # [:validate]
      #   If false, don't validate the associated objects when saving the parent object. +false+ by default.
      # [:autosave]
      #   If true, always save the associated object or destroy it if marked for destruction, when saving the parent object. Off by default.

      # Specifies a many-to-many relationship with another class. This associates two classes via an
      # intermediate join table.  Unless the join table is explicitly specified as an option, it is
      # guessed using the lexical order of the class names. So a join between Developer and Project
      # will give the default join table name of &quot;developers_projects&quot; because &quot;D&quot; outranks &quot;P&quot;.  Note that this precedence
      # is calculated using the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; operator for String.  This means that if the strings are of different lengths,
      # and the strings are equal when compared up to the shortest length, then the longer string is considered of higher
      # lexical precedence than the shorter one.  For example, one would expect the tables &quot;paper_boxes&quot; and &quot;papers&quot;
      # to generate a join table name of &quot;papers_paper_boxes&quot; because of the length of the name &quot;paper_boxes&quot;,
      # but it in fact generates a join table name of &quot;paper_boxes_papers&quot;.  Be aware of this caveat, and use the
      # custom &lt;tt&gt;:join_table&lt;/tt&gt; option if you need to.
      #
      # The join table should not have a primary key or a model associated with it. You must manually generate the
      # join table with a migration such as this:
      #
      #   class CreateDevelopersProjectsJoinTable &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
      #     def self.up
      #       create_table :developers_projects, :id =&gt; false do |t|

      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # Deprecated: Any additional fields added to the join table will be placed as attributes when pulling records out through
      # +has_and_belongs_to_many+ associations. Records returned from join tables with additional attributes will be marked as
      # readonly (because we can't save changes to the additional attributes). It's strongly recommended that you upgrade any
      # associations with attributes to a real join model (see introduction).
      #
      # Adds the following methods for retrieval and query:
      #
      # [collection(force_reload = false)]
      #   Returns an array of all the associated objects.
      #   An empty array is returned if none are found.
      # [collection&lt;&lt;(object, ...)]
      #   Adds one or more objects to the collection by creating associations in the join table
      #   (&lt;tt&gt;collection.push&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;collection.concat&lt;/tt&gt; are aliases to this method).
      # [collection.delete(object, ...)]
      #   Removes one or more objects from the collection by removing their associations from the join table.
      #   This does not destroy the objects.
      # [collection=objects]
      #   Replaces the collection's content by deleting and adding objects as appropriate.
      # [collection_singular_ids]
      #   Returns an array of the associated objects' ids.
      # [collection_singular_ids=ids]
      #   Replace the collection by the objects identified by the primary keys in +ids+.
      # [collection.clear]
      #   Removes every object from the collection. This does not destroy the objects.
      # [collection.empty?]
      #   Returns +true+ if there are no associated objects.
      # [collection.size]
      #   Returns the number of associated objects.
      # [collection.find(id)]
      #   Finds an associated object responding to the +id+ and that
      #   meets the condition that it has to be associated with this object.
      #   Uses the same rules as ActiveRecord::Base.find.
      # [collection.exists?(...)]
      #   Checks whether an associated object with the given conditions exists.
      #   Uses the same rules as ActiveRecord::Base.exists?.
      # [collection.build(attributes = {})]
      #   Returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated
      #   with +attributes+ and linked to this object through the join table, but has not yet been saved.
      # [collection.create(attributes = {})]
      #   Returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated
      #   with +attributes+, linked to this object through the join table, and that has already been saved (if it passed the validation).
      #
      # (+collection+ is replaced with the symbol passed as the first argument, so
      # &lt;tt&gt;has_and_belongs_to_many :categories&lt;/tt&gt; would add among others &lt;tt&gt;categories.empty?&lt;/tt&gt;.)
      #
      # === Example
      #
      # A Developer class declares &lt;tt&gt;has_and_belongs_to_many :projects&lt;/tt&gt;, which will add:
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#projects&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#projects&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#projects.delete&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#projects=&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#project_ids&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#project_ids=&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#projects.clear&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#projects.empty?&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#projects.size&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#projects.find(id)&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#clients.exists?(...)&lt;/tt&gt;
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#projects.build&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;Project.new(&quot;project_id&quot; =&gt; id)&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # * &lt;tt&gt;Developer#projects.create&lt;/tt&gt; (similar to &lt;tt&gt;c = Project.new(&quot;project_id&quot; =&gt; id); c.save; c&lt;/tt&gt;)
      # The declaration may include an options hash to specialize the behavior of the association.
      #
      # === Options
      #
      # [:class_name]
      #   Specify the class name of the association. Use it only if that name can't be inferred
      #   from the association name. So &lt;tt&gt;has_and_belongs_to_many :projects&lt;/tt&gt; will by default be linked to the
      #   Project class, but if the real class name is SuperProject, you'll have to specify it with this option.
      # [:join_table]
      #   Specify the name of the join table if the default based on lexical order isn't what you want.
      #   &lt;b&gt;WARNING:&lt;/b&gt; If you're overwriting the table name of either class, the +table_name+ method
      #   MUST be declared underneath any +has_and_belongs_to_many+ declaration in order to work.
      # [:foreign_key]
      #   Specify the foreign key used for the association. By default this is guessed to be the name
      #   of this class in lower-case and &quot;_id&quot; suffixed. So a Person class that makes a +has_and_belongs_to_many+ association
      #   to Project will use &quot;person_id&quot; as the default &lt;tt&gt;:foreign_key&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:association_foreign_key]
      #   Specify the foreign key used for the association on the receiving side of the association.
      #   By default this is guessed to be the name of the associated class in lower-case and &quot;_id&quot; suffixed.
      #   So if a Person class makes a +has_and_belongs_to_many+ association to Project,
      #   the association will use &quot;project_id&quot; as the default &lt;tt&gt;:association_foreign_key&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:conditions]
      #   Specify the conditions that the associated object must meet in order to be included as a +WHERE+
      #   SQL fragment, such as &lt;tt&gt;authorized = 1&lt;/tt&gt;.  Record creations from the association are scoped if a hash is used.  
      #   &lt;tt&gt;has_many :posts, :conditions =&gt; {:published =&gt; true}&lt;/tt&gt; will create published posts with &lt;tt&gt;@blog.posts.create&lt;/tt&gt; 
      #   or &lt;tt&gt;@blog.posts.build&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:order]
      #   Specify the order in which the associated objects are returned as an &lt;tt&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/tt&gt; SQL fragment,
      #   such as &lt;tt&gt;last_name, first_name DESC&lt;/tt&gt;
      # [:uniq]
      #   If true, duplicate associated objects will be ignored by accessors and query methods.
      # [:finder_sql]
      #   Overwrite the default generated SQL statement used to fetch the association with a manual statement
      # [:counter_sql]
      #   Specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the size of the association. If &lt;tt&gt;:finder_sql&lt;/tt&gt; is
      #   specified but not &lt;tt&gt;:counter_sql&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;:counter_sql&lt;/tt&gt; will be generated by replacing &lt;tt&gt;SELECT ... FROM&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM&lt;/tt&gt;.
      # [:delete_sql]
      #   Overwrite the default generated SQL statement used to remove links between the associated
      #   classes with a manual statement.
      # [:insert_sql]
      #   Overwrite the default generated SQL statement used to add links between the associated classes
      #   with a manual statement.
      # [:extend]
      #   Anonymous module for extending the proxy, see &quot;Association extensions&quot;.
      # [:include]
      #   Specify second-order associations that should be eager loaded when the collection is loaded.
      # [:group]
      #   An attribute name by which the result should be grouped. Uses the &lt;tt&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/tt&gt; SQL-clause.
      # [:having]
      #   Combined with +:group+ this can be used to filter the records that a &lt;tt&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/tt&gt; returns. Uses the &lt;tt&gt;HAVING&lt;/tt&gt; SQL-clause.
      # [:limit]
      #   An integer determining the limit on the number of rows that should be returned.
      # [:offset]
      #   An integer determining the offset from where the rows should be fetched. So at 5, it would skip the first 4 rows.
      # [:select]
      #   By default, this is &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; as in &lt;tt&gt;SELECT * FROM&lt;/tt&gt;, but can be changed if, for example, you want to do a join
      #   but not include the joined columns. Do not forget to include the primary and foreign keys, otherwise it will raise an error.
      # [:readonly]
      #   If true, all the associated objects are readonly through the association.
      # [:validate]
      #   If false, don't validate the associated objects when saving the parent object. +true+ by default.
      # [:autosave]
      #   If true, always save any loaded members and destroy members marked for destruction, when saving the parent object. Off by default.
      #
      # Option examples:
