<h1>While loops</h1>

<p>Now that you are familiar with conditions, it's time to look at another
kind of loop: The <b>while</b> loop.</p>

<p>This type of loop is much more powerful than the one you've seen already.
But it requires understanding conditionals.  It's basic for is:</p>

<pre class="code">
while <em>cond</em>
   ...
end
</pre>

<p>Where <em>cond</em> is a condition like the ones you saw in the last
chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="count">Counting</a></h2>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

<img src="while/01.gif" />

<p>Let's go through this program:</p>
<ol> 
<li>Set <b>count</b> to 0</li>
<li>Since <b>count</b> &lt; 10 we go into the loop.</li>
<li>Inside the loop we print a message and add 1 to <b>count</b>.
    Now <b>count</b> is 1.</li>
<li>Since <b>count</b>&lt; 10 again we go for another loop.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>

<p>This continues on until <b>count</b> is 10.  So the output of this loop
is:</p>

<img src="while/02.gif" />

<p>In other words, a <b>while</b> loop will continue repeating the
loop while the condition is true.  Hence the name <b>while</b>.</p>

<h2><a name="powers">Powers of 2</a></h2>

<p>There are some things are easy to do with a <b>while</b> loop, but very 
difficult with a '<b>n.times</b>'.</p>

<p>Suppose that we want to know the highest power of 2 which is less than
1000.  This is easy with a while loop:</p>

<img src="while/03.gif" />

<img src="while/04.gif" />

<p>Think about how difficult this would be using '<b>n.times</b>'.</p>

<h2><a name="ex">Exercises</a></h2>

<ol>
   <li><p>Rewrite this last program so that the computer asks for
       the maximum number and the program computes the corresponding
       power of two.</p>
       <img src="while/05.gif" />
   </li>
   <li><p>Run the program above, and type <b>1e10</b> as input.
       What happens?</p>
       <p>If you used the <b>String#to_i</b> method, chances are that
       <b>"1e10"</b> was converted to <b>1</b>.  Let's go to <b>irb</b>
       to try this out.</p>
       
       <img src="while/06.gif" />
       
       <p>You see, <b>1e10</b> is a <b>Float</b>.  Thus, you have to
       use <b>String#to_f</b> instead.</p>
   </li>
</ol>
