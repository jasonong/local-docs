    <h2>Ruby Documentation Bundle</h2>

    <p>
    This is a broad set of Ruby documentation packaged into one bundle for convenient access.  All
    of the documents are available for separate download; links are given in the "About the Authors"
    section.  The information is aimed particularly at less experienced Rubyists, because they will
    often be referred to some of these documents in the newsgroup, but it is a useful set of offline
    material for anyone to have.

    <H2>About the Authors</H2>

    <p>
    <b>Gavin Sinclair</b> is a Ruby user since June 2002.  He travelled a long path to Ruby
    maturity, and wanted to share some wisdom with others in the same position.  He packages this
    bundle and wrote the introduction.
    
    <p>
    <b>David Thomas and Andrew Hunt</b> are responsible for the canonical English Ruby document:
    "Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide" (Addison-Wesley), also known as <em>The
      Pickaxe</em> after the picture on the cover.  It is loved for its thorough engagement of the
    reader with the language, its breadth and its excellent reference to all the standard libraries.

    <p>
    Dave and Andy, as they are better known, continue to make stellar contributions to the Ruby
    community.  Between them they have created 'ri' (an indispensible online reference), the Windows
    Ruby distribution, RDoc, and kickstarted the Ruby FAQ.

    <p>
    <b>Mark Slagell</b>, in addition to translating the Ruby Users Guide, wrote <em>Teach Yourself Ruby
      in 21 Days</em> (SAMS), which has received much praise in the Ruby community for helping
    people with the crucial first steps.

    <p>
    <b>Goto "gotoken" Kentaro</b> is a long-time Ruby user who, in addition to translating the Ruby
    Users Guide, has created several useful packages for Ruby, the most commonly-used probably being
    "Benchmark".

    <p>
    <b>Yukihiro "matz" Matsumoto</b>, the creator of Ruby, authored the Ruby Users Guide (in Japanese)
    and the Ruby Reference Manual.  He is also the author of <em>Ruby in a Nutshell</em>, (O'Reilly), a
    very handy desktop guide.

    <p>
    <b>Daniel Carrera and Bill Tjokroaminata</b> are regular Ruby users who sensed a need and
    applied their enthusiasm to the task of creating a well-received tutorial, and the newcomer's
    list respectively.  The tutorial is under active construction (as of 2002-12-30) and the list is
    liable to be updated, so keep these links handy.
