1 About Ruby

1.1 What is Ruby?

    Ruby is a very high level, fully OO programming language. Indeed,
    Ruby is one of the relatively few pure OO languages. Yet despite
    its conceptual simplicity, Ruby is still a powerful and practical
    &quot;industrial strength&quot; development language.

    Ruby selectively integrates many good ideas taken from Perl,
    Python, Smalltalk, Eiffel, ADA, Clu, and Lisp. Ruby combines
    these ideas in a natural, well-coordinated system that embodies
    the principles of least effort and least surprise to a
    substantially greater extent than most comparable languages --
    i.e. you get more bang for your buck, and what you write is more
    likely to give you what you expected to get.  Ruby is thus a
    relatively easy to learn, easy to read, and easy to maintain
    language; yet it is very powerful and sophisticated.

    In addition to common OO features, Ruby also has threads,
    singleton methods, mixins, fully integrated closures and
    iterators, plus proper meta-classes.   Ruby has a true
    mark-and-sweep garbage collector, which makes code more reliable
    and simplifies writing extensions.  In summary, Ruby provides a
    very powerful and very easy to deploy &quot;standing on the shoulders
    of giants&quot; OO scaffolding/framework so that you can more quickly
    and easily build what you want to build, to do what you want to
    do.

    You will find many former (and current) Perl, Python, Java, and
    C++ users on comp.lang.ruby that can help you get up to speed in
    Ruby.

    Finally, Ruby is an &quot;open source&quot; development programming
    language.

2 About comp.lang.ruby.

2.1 Tell me about comp.lang.ruby

    comp.lang.ruby was officially approved in early May, 2000.
    (Conrad Schneiker, the former maintainer of this FAQ, was
    responsible for the &quot;net paperwork&quot; of creating this group.)
    Here is the official charter:

        CHARTER: comp.lang.ruby

        The comp.lang.ruby newsgroup is devoted to discussions of the
        Ruby programming language and related issues.

        Examples of relevant postings include, but are not limited
        to, the following subjects:

        - Bug reports
        - Announcements of software written with Ruby
        - Examples of Ruby code
        - Suggestions for Ruby developers
        - Requests for help from new Ruby programmers

        The newsgroup is not moderated.  Binaries are prohibited
        (except the small PGP type). Advertising is prohibited (except
        for announcements of new Ruby-related products).

        END CHARTER.

2.2 Tell me the posting guidelines for comp.lang.ruby.

    (You should also follow these guidelines for the ruby-list mail
    list, since it is mirrored to comp.lang.ruby.)

    (1) ALWAYS be friendly, considerate, tactful, and tasteful.  We
        want to keep this forum hospitable to the growing ranks of
        newbies, very young people, and their teachers, as well as
        cater to fire breathing wizards.  :-)

    (2) Keep your content relevant and easy to follow. Try to keep
        your content brief and to the point, but also try to include
        all relevant information.

        (a) The general format guidelines (aka USENET Netiquette) are
            matters of common sense and common courtesy that make life
            easier for 3rd parties to follow along (in real time or
            when perusing archives):

            - PLEASE NOTE! Include quoted text from previous posts
              *BEFORE* your responses. And *selectively* quote as much
              as is relevant.
            - Use *plain* text; don't use HTML, RTF, or Word. Most
              mail or newsreader programs have an option for this; if
              yours doesn't, get a (freeware) program or use a
              web-based service that does.
            - Include examples from files as *in-line* text; don't
              use attachments.

        (b) If reporting a problem, give *all* the relevant
            information the first time; this isn't the psychic friends
            newsgroup.  :-)  When appropriate, include:

            - The version of Ruby. (&quot;ruby -v&quot;)
            - The compiler name and version used to build Ruby.
            - The OS type and level. (&quot;uname -a&quot;)
            - The actual error messages.
            - An example (preferably simple) that produces the
              problem.

        (c) If reporting a bug, please copy (cc:) your post to:

                <A HREF="mailto:ruby-bugs@ruby-lang.org" target="_top">mailto:ruby-bugs@ruby-lang.org</A>

            This will enter your report into the Ruby bug database.
            You can browse the database at:

                <A HREF="http://www.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/ruby-bugs" target="_top">http://www.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/ruby-bugs</A>

    (3) Make the subject line maximally informative, so that people
        who should be interested will read your post and so that people
        who wouldn't be interested can easily avoid it.

        *Usefully* describe the contents of your post:

            This is OK:

                &quot;How can I do x with y on z?&quot;
                &quot;Problem: did x, expected y, got z.&quot;
                &quot;Bug: doing x with module y crashed z.&quot;

            This is *NOT* OK:

                &quot;Please help!!!&quot;
                &quot;Newbie question&quot;
                &quot;Need Ruby guru to tell me what's wrong&quot;

    (4) Finally, be considerate: don't be too lazy. If you are
        seeking information, first make a reasonable effort to look it
        up. As appropriate, check the Ruby home page, check the Ruby
        FAQ and other documentation, use deja.com to search past
        comp.lang.ruby postings, and so on.

2.3 Tell me about the prolific Matz poster.

    Matz (aka Yukihiro Matsumoto) is the wizard who created Ruby for
    us, so be nice to him. He is very busy, so be patient when asking
    questions. See the Ruby home page to find out more about him and
    his work. I (Conrad Schneiker) founded comp.lang.ruby at his
    suggestion. Contrary to lots of skepticism, it was approved on
    the first attempt, with 200 yes votes.

2.4 How do the mailing list and newsgroup interrelate?

    The mailing list is older. When the newsgroup was created, they
    diverged. In mid-2001, Dave Thomas created a two-way gateway
    that would &quot;mirror&quot; the newsgroup to the list and vice versa.
    (This was accomplished in 200 lines of Ruby code.) It is not
    perfect; because of variability in the news feed, sometimes
    messages are dropped or duplicated.

    The online archive of the mailing list therefore includes most
    of the traffic on the newsgroup, excluding the posts that were
    made before the creation of the gateway.

    Note: Spam or other inappropriate messages are NOT the
    responsibility of Dave Thomas, who maintains the gateway. He
    does everything in his power to deal with this issue. Do NOT
    report spam to his ISP merely because the messages come from
    his server.

2.5 What are these 5-digit message numbers?

    Historically, every item on the mailing list had a subject
    starting with a string like: <A HREF="/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/99999">[ruby-talk:99999]</A>

    The message numbers were convenient since they were strictly
    serial and formed a good way to refer to a past message. But
    they interfered with threading; Matz removed them after the
    matter was put to a vote in early 2002.

    The news header still refers to this number, should anyone
    wish to retrieve it. On the mailing list this number can
    now be found in the X-Mail-Count: header.

    You can point to a specific message by appending it onto the
    ruby-talk.org URL; i.e. <A HREF="http://ruby-talk.org/12345" target="_top">http://ruby-talk.org/12345</A> will refer
    to message 12345.


3. Anything else?

    If you are new to Ruby (or haven't previously taken the Ruby User
    Survey), please take a moment to anonymously tell us about your
    programming background and about your Ruby-related interests. The
    results will be reported back to the Ruby community from time to
    time. This helps us do a better job of helping each other, and to
    more effectively expand the Ruby community for our mutual benefit.
    The survey is at:

        <A HREF="http://dev.rubycentral.com/survey.html" target="_top">http://dev.rubycentral.com/survey.html</A>

    This FAQ was produced by Conrad Schneiker (schneiker@jump.net).
    It is now maintained by Hal Fulton (hal9000@hypermetrics.com).
    I'm interested in corrections and suggestions, but remember that
    the purpose of this FAQ is to be a brief and simple introduction
    for new comp.lang.ruby readers.

    In closing, one of the reasons that Ruby was designed to be
    relatively simple, uniform, yet very powerful was to make serious
    programming (among other kinds) fun.  We hope you will help us
    keep comp.lang.ruby fun as well. Enjoy.  :-)
