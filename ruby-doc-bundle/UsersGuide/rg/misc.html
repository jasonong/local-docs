<p>This chapter addresses a few practical issues.</p>
<h3><a name="label:0" id="label:0">Statement delimiters</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "Statement delimiters" -->
<p>Some languages require some kind of punctuation, often a semicolon
(<code>;</code>), to end each statement in a program.  Ruby
instead follows the convention used in shells like <code>sh</code> and
<code>csh</code>.  Multiple statements on one line must be
separated by semicolons, but they are not required at the end of a
line; a linefeed is treated like a semicolon.  If a line ends
with a backslash (<code>\</code>), the linefeed following it is
ignored; this allows you to have a single logical line that spans
several lines.</p>
<h3><a name="label:1" id="label:1">Comments</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "Comments" -->
<p>Why write comments?  Although well written code tends to be
self-documenting, it is often helpful to scribble in the margins, and
it can be a mistake to believe that others will be able to look at
your code and immediately see it the way you do. Besides, for
practical purposes, you yourself are a different person within a few
days anyway; which of us hasn't gone back to fix or enhance a program
after the passage of time and said, I know I wrote this, but what in
blazes does it mean?</p>
<p>Some experienced programmers will point out, quite correctly, that
contradictory or outdated comments can be worse than none at all.
Certainly, comments shouldn't be a substitute for readable code; if
your code is unclear, it's probably also buggy.  You may find that you
need to comment more while you are learning ruby, and then less as you
become better at expressing your ideas in simple, elegant, readable
code.</p>
<p>Ruby follows a common scripting convention, which is to use a pound
symbol (<code>#</code>) to denote the start of a comment.  Anything
following an unquoted <code>#</code>, to the end of the line on which it
appears, is ignored by the interpreter.</p>
<p>Also, to facilitate large comment blocks, the ruby interpreter also
ignores anything between a line starting with "<code>=begin</code>" and
another line starting with "<code>=end</code>".</p>
<p><table align="center" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="6" bgcolor="#e8e8d8"><tr><td><pre><font color="black">#!/usr/bin/env ruby

=begin
**********************************************************************
  This is a comment block, something you write for the benefit of
  human readers (including yourself).  The interpreter ignores it.
  There is no need for a '#' at the start of every line.
**********************************************************************
=end</font></pre></td></tr></table>
<h3><a name="label:2" id="label:2">Organizing your code</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "Organizing your code" -->
<p>The ruby interpreter processes code as it reads it.  There is
nothing like a compilation phase; if something hasn't been read yet,
it is simply undefined.</p>
<p><table align="center" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="6" bgcolor="#e8e8d8"><tr><td><pre><font color="black"># this results in an "undefined method" error:

print successor(3),"\n"

def successor(x)
  x + 1
end</font></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This does not, as it might seem at first glance, force you to
organize your code in a strictly bottom-up fashion.  When the
interpreter encounters a method definition, it can safely include
undefined references, as long as you can be sure they will be defined
by the time the method is actually invoked:</p>
<p><table align="center" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="6" bgcolor="#e8e8d8"><tr><td><pre><font color="black"># Conversion of fahrenheit to celsius, broken
# down into two steps.

def f_to_c(f)
  scale(f - 32.0)  # This is a forward reference, but it's okay.
end

def scale(x)
  x * 5.0 / 9.0
end

printf "%.1f is a comfortable temperature.\n", f_to_c(72.3)</font></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>So while this may seem less convenient than what you may be used to
in Perl or Java, it is less restrictive than trying to write C without
prototypes (which would require you to always maintain a partial
ordering of what references what).  Putting top-level code at the
bottom of a source file always works.  And even this is less of an
annoyance than it might at first seem.  A sensible and painless way to
enforce the behavior you want is to define a <code>main</code> function at
the top of the file, and call it from the bottom.</p>
<p><table align="center" width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="6" bgcolor="#e8e8d8"><tr><td><pre><font color="black">#!/usr/bin/env ruby

def main
  # Express the top level logic here...
end

# ... put support code here, organized as you see fit ...

main # ... and start execution here.</font></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>It also helps that ruby provides tools for breaking complicated
programs into readable, reusable, logically related chunks.  We have
already seen the use of <code>include</code> for accessing modules.  You
will also find the <code>load</code> and <code>require</code> facilities useful.
<code>load</code> works as if the file it refers to were copied and pasted
in (something like the <code>#include</code> preprocessor directive in
C). <code>require</code> is somewhat more sophisticated, causing code
to be loaded at most once and only when needed.  There are other
differences between <code>load</code> and <code>require</code>; refer to the
language manual or the FAQ for more information.</p>
<h3><a name="label:3" id="label:3">That's it...</a></h3><!-- RDLabel: "That's it..." -->
<p>This tutorial should be enough to get you started writing programs in
Ruby.  As further questions arise, you can dig into the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/man-1.4/">reference
manual</a> to
learn about ruby in more depth.  The
<a href="http://dev.rubycentral.com/faq/rubyfaq.html">FAQ</a> and
<a href="http://dev.rubycentral.com/ref/">library reference</a> are also
important resources.</p>
<p>Good luck, and happy coding!</p>
